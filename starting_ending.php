<p class="depart_p">
                            <strong>4.01</strong><br />
                      Unless the home club shall have given previous notice that the game has  been postponed or will be delayed in starting, the umpire, or umpires,  shall enter the playing field five minutes before the hour set for the  game to begin and proceed directly to home base where they shall be met  by the managers of the opposing teams. In sequence_ (a) First, the home  manager shall give his batting order to the umpire in chief, in  duplicate. (b) Next, the visiting manager shall give his batting order  to the umpire in chief, in duplicate. (c) The umpire in chief shall  make certain that the original and copies of the respective batting  orders are identical, and then tender a copy of each batting order to  the opposing manager. The copy retained by the umpire shall be the  official batting order. The tender of the batting order by the umpire  shall establish the batting orders. Thereafter, no substitutions shall  be made by either manager, except as provided in the rules. (d) As soon  as the home team's batting order is handed to the umpire in chief the  umpires are in charge of the playing field and from that moment they  shall have sole authority to determine when a game shall be called,  suspended or resumed on account of weather or the condition of the  playing field. Obvious errors in the batting order, which are noticed  by the umpire in chief before he calls &quot;Play&quot; for the start of the  game, should be called to the attention of the manager or captain of  the team in error, so the correction can be made before the game  starts. For example, if a manager has inadvertently listed only eight  men in the batting order, or has listed two players with the same last  name but without an identifying initial and the errors are noticed by  the umpire before he calls &quot;play,&quot; he shall cause such error or errors  to be corrected before he calls &quot;play&quot; to start the game. Teams should  not be &quot;trapped&quot; later by some mistake that obviously was inadvertent  and which can be corrected before the game starts. <br />
                      <br />
                      <strong> 4.02</strong><br />
                      The players of the home team shall take their defensive positions, the  first batter of the visiting team shall take his position in the  batter's box, the umpire shall call &quot;Play&quot; and the game shall start. <br />
                      <br />
                      <strong> 4.03</strong><br />
                      When the ball is put in play at the start of, or during a game, all  fielders other than the catcher shall be on fair territory. (a) The  catcher shall station himself directly back of the plate. He may leave  his position at any time to catch a pitch or make a play except that  when the batter is being given an intentional base on balls, the  catcher must stand with both feet within the lines of the catcher's box  until the ball leaves the pitcher's hand. PENALTY: Balk. (b) The  pitcher, while in the act of delivering the ball to the batter, shall  take his legal position; (c) Except the pitcher and the catcher, any  fielder may station himself anywhere in fair territory; (d) Except the  batter, or a runner attempting to score, no offensive player shall  cross the catcher's lines when the ball is in play.
                      </br></br><strong> 4.04<br />
                          </strong>The  batting order shall be followed throughout the game unless a player is  substituted for another. In that case the substitute shall take the  place of the replaced player in the batting order.<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong> 4.05</strong><br />
                          (a) The offensive team shall station two base coaches on the field  during its term at bat, one near first base and one near third base.  (b) Base coaches shall be limited to two in number and shall (1) be in  team uniform, and (2) remain within the coach's box at all times.  PENALTY: The offending base coach shall be removed from the game, and  shall leave the playing field. It has been common practice for many  years for some coaches to put one foot outside the coach's box or stand  astride or otherwise be slightly outside the coaching box lines. The  coach shall not be considered out of the box unless the opposing  manager complains, and then, the umpire shall strictly enforce the rule  and require all coaches (on both teams) to remain in the coach's box at  all times. It is also common practice for a coach who has a play at his  base to leave the coach's box to signal the player to slide, advance or  return to a base. This may be allowed if the coach does not interfere  with the play in any manner.<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>4.06</strong><br />
                          (a) No manager, player, substitute, coach, trainer or batboy shall at  any time, whether from the bench, the coach's box or on the playing  field, or elsewhere_ (1) Incite, or try to incite, by word or sign a  demonstration by spectators; (2) Use language which will in any manner  refer to or reflect upon opposing players, an umpire, or any spectator;  (3) Call &quot;Time,&quot; or employ any other word or phrase or commit any act  while the ball is alive and in play for the obvious purpose of trying  to make the pitcher commit a balk. (4) Make intentional contact with  the umpire in any manner. (b) No fielder shall take a position in the  batter's line of vision, and with deliberate unsportsmanlike intent,  act in a manner to distract the batter. PENALTY: The offender shall be  removed from the game and shall leave the playing field, and, if a balk  is made, it shall be nullified. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>4.07</strong><br />
                          When a manager, player, coach or trainer is ejected from a game, he  shall leave the field immediately and take no further part in that  game. He shall remain in the club house or change to street clothes and  either leave the park or take a seat in the grandstand well removed  from the vicinity of his team's bench or bullpen. If a manager, coach  or player is under suspension he may not be in the dugout or press box  during the course of a game. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong> 4.08</strong><br />
                          When the occupants of a player's bench show violent disapproval of an  umpire's decision, the umpire shall first give warning that such  disapproval shall cease. If such action continues_ PENALTY: The umpire  shall order the offenders from the bench to the club house. If he is  unable to detect the offender, or offenders, he may clear the bench of  all substitute players. The manager of the offending team shall have  the privilege of recalling to the playing field only those players  needed for substitution in the game.<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>4.09</strong><br />
                          HOW A TEAM SCORES. (a) One run shall be scored each time a runner  legally advances to and touches first, second, third and home base  before three men are put out to end the inning. EXCEPTION: A run is not  scored if the runner advances to home base during a play in which the  third out is made (1) by the batter runner before he touches first  base; (2) by any runner being forced out; or (3) by a preceding runner  who is declared out because he failed to touch one of the bases. (b)  When the winning run is scored in the last half inning of a regulation  game, or in the last half of an extra inning, as the result of a base  on balls, hit batter or any other play with the bases full which forces  the runner on third to advance, the umpire shall not declare the game  ended until the runner forced to advance from third has touched home  base and the batter runner has touched first base. An exception will be  if fans rush onto the field and physically prevent the runner from  touching home plate or the batter from touching first base. In such  cases, the umpires shall award the runner the base because of the  obstruction by the fans. PENALTY: If the runner on third refuses to  advance to and touch home base in a reasonable time, the umpire shall  disallow the run, call out the offending player and order the game  resumed. If, with two out, the batter runner refuses to advance to and  touch first base, the umpire shall disallow the run, call out the  offending player, and order the game resumed. If, before two are out,  the batter runner refuses to advance to and touch first base, the run  shall count, but the offending player shall be called out. Approved  Ruling: No run shall score during a play in which the third out is made  by the batter runner before he touches first base. Example: One out,  Jones on second, Smith on first. The batter, Brown, hits safely. Jones  scores. Smith is out on the throw to the plate. Two outs. But Brown  missed first base. The ball is thrown to first, an appeal is made, and  Brown is out. Three outs. Since Jones crossed the plate during a play  in which the third out was made by the batter runner before he touched  first base, Jones' run does not count. Approved Ruling: Following  runners are not affected by an act of a preceding runner unless two are  out. Example: One out, Jones on second, Smith on first, and batter,  Brown, hits home run inside the park. Jones fails to touch third on his  way to the plate. Smith and Brown score. The defense holds the ball on  third, appeals to umpire, and Jones is out. Smith's and Brown's runs  count. Approved Ruling: Two out, Jones on second, Smith on first and  batter, Brown, hits home run inside the park. All three runs cross the  plate. But Jones missed third base, and on appeal is declared out.  Three outs. Smith's and Brown's runs are voided. No score on the play.  Approved Ruling: One out, Jones on third, Smith on second. Batter Brown  flies out to center. Two out. Jones scores after catch and Smith scores  on bad throw to plate. But Jones, on appeal, is adjudged to have left  third before the catch and is out. Three outs. No runs. Approved  Ruling: Two out, bases full, batter hits home run over fence. Batter,  on appeal, is declared out for missing first base. Three outs. No run  counts. Here is a general statement that covers: When a runner misses a  base and a fielder holds the ball on a missed base, or on the base  originally occupied by the runner if a fly ball is caught, and appeals  for the umpire's decision, the runner is out when the umpire sustains  the appeal; all runners may score if possible, except that with two out  the runner is out at the moment he misses the bag, if an appeal is  sustained as applied to the following runners. Approved Ruling: One  out, Jones on third, Smith on first, and Brown flies out to right  field. Two outs. Jones tags up and scores after the catch. Smith  attempted to return to first but the right fielder's throw beat him to  the base. three outs. But Jones scored before the throw to catch Smith  reached first base, hence Jones' run counts. It was not a force play. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong> 4.10</strong><br />
                          (a) A regulation game consists of nine innings, unless extended because  of a tie score, or shortened (1) because the home team needs none of  its half of the ninth inning or only a fraction of it, or (2) because  the umpire calls the game. EXCEPTION: National Association leagues may  adopt a rule providing that one or both games of a doubleheader shall  be seven innings in length. In such games, any of these rules applying  to the ninth inning shall apply to the seventh inning. (b) If the score  is tied after nine completed innings play shall continue until (1) the  visiting team has scored more total runs than the home team at the end  of a completed inning, or (2) the home team scores the winning run in  an uncompleted inning. (c) If a game is called, it is a regulation  game: (1) If five innings have been completed; (2) If the home team has  scored more runs in four or four and a fraction half innings than the  visiting team has scored in five completed half innings; (3) If the  home team scores one or more runs in its half of the fifth inning to  tie the score. (d) If each team has the same number of runs when the  game ends, the umpire shall declare it a &quot;Tie Game.&quot; (e) If a game is  called before it has become a regulation game, the umpire shall declare  it &quot;No Game.&quot; (f) Rain checks will not be honored for any regulation or  suspended game which has progressed to or beyond a point of play  described in 4.10(c)<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>4.11</strong><br />
                          The score of a regulation game is the total number of runs scored by  each team at the moment the game ends. (a) The game ends when the  visiting team completes its half of the ninth inning if the home team  is ahead. (b) The game ends when the ninth inning is completed, if the  visiting team is ahead. (c) If the home team scores the winning run in  its half of the ninth inning (or its half of an extra inning after a  tie), the game ends immediately when the winning run is scored.  EXCEPTION: If the last batter in a game hits a home run out of the  playing field, the batter runner and all runners on base are permitted  to score, in accordance with the base running rules, and the game ends  when the batter runner touches home plate. APPROVED RULING: The batter  hits a home run out of the playing field to win the game in the last  half of the ninth or an extra inning, but is called out for passing a  preceding runner. The game ends immediately when the winning run is  scored. (d) A called game ends at the moment the umpire terminates  play. EXCEPTION: If the game is called while an inning is in progress  and before it is completed, the game becomes a SUSPENDED game in each  of the following situations: (1) The visiting team has scored one or  more runs to tie the score and the home team has not scored; (2) The  visiting team has scored one or more runs to take the lead and the home  team has not tied the score or retaken the lead. National Association  Leagues may also adopt the following rules for suspended games in  addition to 4.11 (d) (1) &amp; (2) above. (If adopted by a National  Association League, Rule 4.10 (c) (d) &amp; (e) would not apply to  their games.): (3) The game has not become a regulation game (4 1/2  innings with the home team ahead, or 5 innings with the visiting club  ahead or tied). (4) Any regulation game tied at the point play is  stopped because of weather, curfew or other reason. (5) If a game is  suspended before it becomes a regulation game, and is continued prior  to another regularly scheduled game, the regularly scheduled game will  be limited to seven innings. (6) If a game is suspended after it is a  regulation game, and is continued prior to another regularly scheduled  game, the regularly scheduled game will be a nine inning game.  EXCEPTION: The above sections (3), (4), (5) &amp; (6) will not apply to  the last scheduled game between the two teams during the championship  season, or League Playoffs. Any suspended game not completed prior to  the last scheduled game between the two teams during the championship  season, will become a called game.<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong> 4.12</strong><br />
                          SUSPENDED GAMES. (a) A league shall adopt the following rules providing  for completion at a future date of games terminated for any of the  following reasons: (1) A curfew imposed by law; (2) A time limit  permissible under league rules; (3) Light failure or malfunction of a  mechanical field device under control of the home club. (Mechanical  field device shall include automatic tarpaulin or water removal  equipment). (4) Darkness, when a law prevents the lights from being  turned on. (5) Weather, if the game is called while an inning is in  progress and before it is completed, and one of the following  situations prevails: (i) The visiting team has scored one or more runs  to tie the score, and the home team has not scored. (ii) The visiting  team has scored one or more runs to take the lead, and the home team  has not tied the score or retaken the lead. (b) Such games shall be  known as suspended games. No game called because of a curfew, weather,  or a time limit shall be a suspended game unless it has progressed far  enough to have been a regulation game under the provisions of Rule  4.10. A game called under the provisions of 4.12(a), (3) or (4) shall  be a suspended game at any time after it starts. NOTE: Weather and  similar conditions_4.12 (a) (1 through 5)_shall take precedence in  determining whether a called game shall be a suspended game. A game can  only be considered a suspended game if stopped for any of the five (5)  reasons specified in Section (a). Any regulation game called due to  weather with the score tied (unless situation outlined in 4.12 (a) (5)  (i) prevails) is a tie game and must be replayed in its entirety. (c) A  suspended game shall be resumed and completed as follows: (1)  Immediately preceding the next scheduled single game between the two  clubs on the same grounds; or (2) Immediately preceding the next  scheduled doubleheader between the two clubs on the same grounds, if no  single game remains on the schedule; or (3) If suspended on the last  scheduled date between the two clubs in that city, transferred and  played on the grounds of the opposing club, if possible; (i)  Immediately preceding the next scheduled single game, or (ii)  Immediately preceding the next scheduled doubleheader, if no single  game remains on the schedule. (4) If a suspended game has not been  resumed and completed on the last date scheduled for the two clubs, it  shall be a called game. (d) A suspended game shall be resumed at the  exact point of suspension of the original game. The completion of a  suspended game is a continuation of the original game. The lineup and  batting order of both teams shall be exactly the same as the lineup and  batting order at the moment of suspension, subject to the rules  governing substitution. Any player may be replaced by a player who had  not been in the game prior to the suspension. No player removed before  the suspension may be returned to the lineup. A player who was not with  the club when the game was suspended may be used as a substitute, even  if he has taken the place of a player no longer with the club who would  not have been eligible because he had been removed from the lineup  before the game was suspended. If immediately prior to the call of a  suspended game, a substitute pitcher has been announced but has not  retired the side or pitched until the batter becomes a baserunner, such  pitcher, when the suspended game is later resumed may, but is not  required to start the resumed portion of the game. However, if he does  not start he will be considered as having been substituted for and may  not be used in that game. (e) Rain checks will not be honored for any  regulation or suspended game which has progressed to or beyond a point  of play described in 4.10 (c). <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>4.13</strong><br />
                          RULES GOVERNING DOUBLEHEADERS. (a) (1) Only two championship games  shall be played on one date. Completion of a suspended game shall not  violate this rule. (2) If two games are scheduled to be played for one  admission on one date, the first game shall be the regularly scheduled  game for that date. (b) After the start of the first game of a  doubleheader, that game shall be completed before the second game of  the doubleheader shall begin. (c) The second game of a doubleheader  shall start twenty minutes after the first game is completed, unless a  longer interval (not to exceed thirty minutes) is declared by the  umpire in chief and announced to the opposing managers at the end of  the first game. EXCEPTION: If the league president has approved a  request of the home club for a longer interval between games for some  special event, the umpire in chief shall declare such longer interval  and announce it to the opposing managers. The umpire in chief of the  first game shall be the timekeeper controlling the interval between  games. (d) The umpire shall start the second game of a doubleheader, if  at all possible, and play shall continue as long as ground conditions,  local time restrictions, or weather permit. (e) When a regularly  scheduled doubleheader is delayed in starting for any cause, any game  that is started is the first game of the doubleheader. (f) When a  rescheduled game is part of a doubleheader the rescheduled game shall  be the second game, and the first game shall be the regularly scheduled  game for that date. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>4.14</strong><br />
                          The umpire in chief shall order the playing field lights turned on  whenever in his opinion darkness makes further play in daylight  hazardous.<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>4.15</strong><br />
                          A game may be forfeited to the opposing team when a team_ (a) Fails to  appear upon the field, or being upon the field, refuses to start play  within five minutes after the umpire has called &quot;Play&quot; at the appointed  hour for beginning the game, unless such delayed appearance is, in the  umpire's judgment, unavoidable; (b) Employs tactics palpably designed  to delay or shorten the game; (c) Refuses to continue play during a  game unless the game has been suspended or terminated by the umpire;  (d) Fails to resume play, after a suspension, within one minute after  the umpire has called &quot;Play;&quot; (e) After warning by the umpire,  willfully and persistently violates any rules of the game; (f) Fails to  obey within a reasonable time the umpire's order for removal of a  player from the game; (g) Fails to appear for the second game of a  doubleheader within twenty minutes after the close of the first game  unless the umpire in chief of the first game shall have extended the  time of the intermission<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>4.16</strong><br />
                          A game shall be forfeited to the visiting team if, after it has been  suspended, the order of the umpire to groundskeepers respecting  preparation of the field for resumption of play are not complied with. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>4.17</strong><br />
                          A game shall be forfeited to the opposing team when a team is unable or  refuses to place nine players on the field.<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>4.18</strong><br />
                          If the umpire declares a game forfeited he shall transmit a written  report to the league president within twenty four hours thereafter, but  failure of such transmittal shall not effect the forfeiture. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>4.19</strong><br />
                          PROTESTING GAMES. Each league shall adopt rules governing procedure for  protesting a game, when a manager claims that an umpire's decision is  in violation of these rules. No protest shall ever be permitted on  judgment decisions by the umpire. In all protested games, the decision  of the League President shall be final. Even if it is held that the  protested decision violated the rules, no replay of the game will be  ordered unless in the opinion of the League President the violation  adversely affected the protesting team's chances of winning the game.  Whenever a manager protests a game because of alleged misapplication of  the rules the protest will not be recognized unless the umpires are  notified at the time the play under protest occurs and before the next  pitch is made or a runner is retired. A protest arising on a game  ending play may be filed until 12 noon the following day with the  League Office.</p>
