                        <strong> ADJUDGED</strong> is a judgment decision by the umpire.<br />
                        <br />
                      An <strong>APPEAL</strong> is the act of a fielder in claiming violation of the                     rules by the offensive team.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>A</strong> <strong>BALK</strong> is an illegal act by the pitcher with a runner or                     runners on base, entitling all runners to advance one base.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>A BALL </strong>is a pitch which does not enter the strike zone in                     flight and is not struck at by the batter. If the pitch                     touches the ground and bounces through the strike zone it is a                     &quot;ball.&quot; If such a pitch touches the batter, he shall be                     awarded first base. If the batter swings at such a pitch after                     two strikes, the ball cannot be caught, for the purposes of                     Rule 6.05 (c) and 6.09 (b). If the batter hits such a pitch,                     the ensuing action shall be the same as if he hit the ball in                     flight.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>A BASE</strong> is one of four points which must be touched by a runner                     in order to score a run; more usually applied to the canvas                     bags and the rubber plate which mark the base points.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>A BASE COACH </strong>is a team member in uniform who is stationed in                     the coach's box at first or third base to direct the batter                     and the runners.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>A BASE ON BALLS</strong> is an award of first base granted to a batter                     who, during his time at bat, receives four pitches outside the                     strike zone.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>A BATTER</strong> is an offensive player who takes his position in the                     batter's box.<br />
                      <strong><br />
                        BATTER RUNNER </strong>is a term that identifies the offensive player                     who has just finished his time at bat until he is put out or                     until the play on which he became a runner ends.<br />
                      <br />
                      The <strong>BATTER'S BOX</strong> is the area within which the batter shall                     stand during his time at bat.<br />
                      <br />
                      The<strong> BATTERY</strong> is the pitcher and catcher. <strong>BENCH OR DUGOUT</strong> is the                     seating facilities reserved for players, substitutes and other                     team members in uniform when they are not actively engaged on                     the playing field.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>A BUNT</strong> is a batted ball not swung at, but intentionally met                     with the bat and tapped slowly within the infield.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>A CALLED GAME</strong> is one in which, for any reason, the umpire in                     chief terminates play.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>A CATCH</strong> is the act of a fielder in getting secure possession                     in his hand or glove of a ball in flight and firmly holding                     it; providing he does not use his cap, protector, pocket or                     any other part of his uniform in getting possession. It is not                     a catch, however, if simultaneously or immediately following                     his contact with the ball, he collides with a player, or with                     a wall, or if he falls down, and as a result of such collision                     or falling, drops the ball. It is not a catch if a fielder                     touches a fly ball which then hits a member of the offensive                     team or an umpire and then is caught by another defensive                     player. If the fielder has made the catch and drops the ball                     while in the act of making a throw following the catch, the                     ball shall be adjudged to have been caught. In establishing                     the validity of the catch, the fielder shall hold the ball                     long enough to prove that he has complete control of the ball                     and that his release of the ball is voluntary and intentional.                     A catch is legal if the ball is finally held by any fielder,                     even though juggled, or held by another fielder before it                     touches the ground. Runners may leave their bases the instant                     the first fielder touches the ball. A fielder may reach over a                     fence, railing, rope or other line of demarcation to make a                     catch. He may jump on top of a railing, or canvas that may be                     in foul ground. No interference should be allowed when a                     fielder reaches over a fence, railing, rope or into a stand to                     catch a ball. He does so at his own risk. If a fielder,                     attempting a catch at the edge of the dugout, is &quot;held up&quot; and                     kept from an apparent fall by a player or players of either                     team and the catch is made, it shall be allowed.<br />
                      <br />
                      The <strong>CATCHER</strong> is the fielder who takes his position back of the                     home base.<br />
                      <br />
                      The <strong>CATCHER'S BOX</strong> is that area within which the catcher shall                     stand until the pitcher delivers the ball.<br />
                      <br />
                      The<strong> CLUB </strong>is a person or group of persons responsible for                     assembling the team personnel, providing the playing field and                     required facilities, and representing the team in relations                     with the league.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>A COACH </strong>is a team member in uniform appointed by the manager                     to perform such duties as the manager may designate, such as                     but not limited to acting as base coach.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>A DEAD BALL</strong> is a ball out of play because of a legally created                     temporary suspension of play. The DEFENSE (or DEFENSIVE) is                     the team, or any player of the team, in the field.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>A DOUBLE HEADER</strong> is two regularly scheduled or rescheduled                     games, played in immediate succession.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>A DOUBLE PLAY</strong> is a play by the defense in which two offensive                     players are put out as a result of continuous action,                     providing there is no error between putouts.<br />
                      (a) A force double play is one in which both putouts are force                     plays.<br />
                      (b) A reverse force double play is one in which the first out                     is a force play and the second out is made on a runner for                     whom the force is removed by reason of the first out. Examples                     of reverse force plays: runner on first, one out; batter                     grounds to first baseman, who steps on first base (one out)                     and throws to second baseman or shortstop for the second out                     (a tag play). Another example: bases loaded, none out; batter                     grounds to third baseman, who steps on third base (one out);                     then throws to catcher for the second out (tag play).<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>DUGOUT (See definition of BENCH)</strong><br />
                      <br />
                      A FAIR BALL is a batted ball that settles on fair ground                     between home and first base, or between home and third base,                     or that is on or over fair territory when bounding to the                     outfield past first or third base, or that touches first,                     second or third base, or that first falls on fair territory on                     or beyond first base or third base, or that, while on or over                     fair territory touches the person of an umpire or player, or                     that, while over fair territory, passes out of the playing                     field in flight. A fair fly shall be judged according to the                     relative position of the ball and the foul line, including the                     foul pole, and not as to whether the fielder is on fair or                     foul territory at the time he touches the ball. If a fly ball                     lands in the infield between home and first base, or home and                     third base, and then bounces to foul territory without                     touching a player or umpire and before passing first or third                     base, it is a foul ball; or if the ball settles on foul                     territory or is touched by a player on foul territory, it is a                     foul ball. If a fly ball lands on or beyond first or third                     base and then bounces to foul territory, it is a fair hit.                     Clubs, increasingly, are erecting tall foul poles at the fence                     line with a wire netting extending along the side of the pole                     on fair territory above the fence to enable the umpires more                     accurately to judge fair and foul balls.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>FAIR TERRITORY</strong> is that part of the playing field within, and                     including the first base and third base lines, from home base                     to the bottom of the playing field fence and perpendicularly                     upwards. All foul lines are in fair territory.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>A FIELDER</strong> is any defensive player.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>FIELDER'S CHOICE </strong>is the act of a fielder who handles a fair                     grounder and, instead of throwing to first base to put out the                     batter runner, throws to another base in an attempt to put out                     a preceding runner. The term is also used by scorers (a) to                     account for the advance of the batter runner who takes one or                     more extra bases when the fielder who handles his safe hit                     attempts to put out a preceding runner; (b) to account for the                     advance of a runner (other than by stolen base or error) while                     a fielder is attempting to put out another runner; and (c) to                     account for the advance of a runner made solely because of the                     defensive team's indifference (undefended steal).<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>A FLY BALL</strong> is a batted ball that goes high in the air in                     flight.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>A FORCE PLAY</strong> is a play in which a runner legally loses his                     right to occupy a base by reason of the batter becoming a                     runner. Confusion regarding this play is removed by                     remembering that frequently the &quot;force&quot; situation is removed                     during the play. Example: Man on first, one out, ball hit                     sharply to first baseman who touches the bag and batter runner                     is out. The force is removed at that moment and runner                     advancing to second must be tagged. If there had been a runner                     on third or second, and either of these runners scored before                     the tag out at second, the run counts. Had the first baseman                     thrown to second and the ball then had been returned to first,                     the play at second was a force out, making two outs, and the                     return throw to first ahead of the runner would have made                     three outs. In that case, no run would score. Example: Not a                     force out. One out. Runner on first and third. Batter flies                     out. Two out. Runner on third tags up and scores. Runner on                     first tries to retouch before throw from fielder reaches first                     baseman, but does not get back in time and is out. Three outs.                     If, in umpire's judgment, the runner from third touched home                     before the ball was held at first base, the run counts.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>A FORFEITED GAME</strong> is a game declared ended by the umpire in                     chief in favor of the offended team by the score of 9 to 0,                     for violation of the rules.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>A FOUL BALL</strong> is a batted ball that settles on foul territory                     between home and first base, or between home and third base,                     or that bounds past first or third base on or over foul                     territory, or that first falls on foul territory beyond first                     or third base, or that, while on or over foul territory,                     touches the person of an umpire or player, or any object                     foreign to the natural ground. A foul fly shall be judged                     according to the relative position of the ball and the foul                     line, including the foul pole, and not as to whether the                     infielder is on foul or fair territory at the time he touches                     the ball. A batted ball not touched by a fielder, which hits                     the pitcher's rubber and rebounds into foul territory, between                     home and first, or between home and third base is a foul ball.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>FOUL TERRITORY </strong>is that part of the playing field outside the                     first and third base lines extended to the fence and                     perpendicularly upwards.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>A FOUL TIP</strong> is a batted ball that goes sharp and direct from                     the bat to the catcher's hands and is legally caught. It is                     not a foul tip unless caught and any foul tip that is caught                     is a strike, and the ball is in play. It is not a catch if it                     is a rebound, unless the ball has first touched the catcher's                     glove or hand.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>A GROUND BALL</strong> is a batted ball that rolls or bounces close to                     the ground.<br />
                      <br />
                      The<strong> HOME TEAM </strong>is the team on whose grounds the game is played,                     or if the game is played on neutral grounds, the home team                     shall be designated by mutual agreement.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>ILLEGAL (or ILLEGALLY)is contrary to these rules.</strong><br />
                      <br />
                      An <strong>ILLEGAL PITCH </strong>is (1) a pitch delivered to the batter when                     the pitcher does not have his pivot foot in contact with the                     pitcher's plate; (2) a quick return pitch. An illegal pitch                     when runners are on base is a balk.<br />
                      <br />
                      An <strong>INFIELDER </strong>is a fielder who occupies a position in the                     infield.<br />

                      An <strong>INFIELD FLY</strong> is a fair fly ball (not including a line drive                     nor an attempted bunt) which can be caught by an infielder                     with ordinary effort, when first and second, or first, second                     and third bases are occupied, before two are out. The pitcher,                     catcher and any outfielder who stations himself in the infield                     on the play shall be considered infielders for the purpose of                     this rule. When it seems apparent that a batted ball will be                     an Infield Fly, the umpire shall immediately declare &quot;Infield                     Fly&quot; for the benefit of the runners. If the ball is near the                     baselines, the umpire shall declare &quot;Infield Fly, if Fair.&quot;                     The ball is alive and runners may advance at the risk of the                     ball being caught, or retouch and advance after the ball is                     touched, the same as on any fly ball. If the hit becomes a                     foul ball, it is treated the same as any foul. If a declared                     Infield Fly is allowed to fall untouched to the ground, and                     bounces foul before passing first or third base, it is a foul                     ball. If a declared Infield Fly falls untouched to the ground                     outside the baseline, and bounces fair before passing first or                     third base, it is an Infield Fly. On the infield fly rule the                     umpire is to rule whether the ball could ordinarily have been                     handled by an infielder not by some arbitrary limitation such                     as the grass, or the base lines. The umpire must rule also                     that a ball is an infield fly, even if handled by an                     outfielder, if, in the umpire's judgment, the ball could have                     been as easily handled by an infielder. The infield fly is in                     no sense to be considered an appeal play. The umpire's                     judgment must govern, and the decision should be made                     immediately. When an infield fly rule is called, runners may                     advance at their own risk. If on an infield fly rule, the                     infielder intentionally drops a fair ball, the ball remains in                     play despite the provisions of Rule 6.05 (L). The infield fly                     rule takes precedence.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>IN FLIGHT </strong>describes a batted, thrown, or pitched ball which                     has not yet touched the ground or some object other than a                     fielder.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>IN JEOPARDY</strong> is a term indicating that the ball is in play and                     an offensive player may be put out.<br />
                      <br />
                      An <strong>INNING</strong> is that portion of a game within which the teams                     alternate on offense and defense and in which there are three                     putouts for each team. Each team's time at bat is a half                     inning.<br />
                      <strong><br />
                        INTERFERENCE</strong><br />
                      (a) Offensive interference is an act by the team at bat which                     interferes with, obstructs, impedes, hinders or confuses any                     fielder attempting to make a play. If the umpire declares the                     batter, batter runner, or a runner out for interference, all                     other runners shall return to the last base that was in the                     judgment of the umpire, legally touched at the time of the                     interference, unless otherwise provided by these rules. In the                     event the batter runner has not reached first base, all                     runners shall return to the base last occupied at the time of                     the pitch.<br />
                      (b) Defensive interference is an act by a fielder which                     hinders or prevents a batter from hitting a pitch.<br />
                      (c) Umpire's interference occurs (1) When an umpire hinders,                     impedes or prevents a catcher's throw attempting to prevent a                     stolen base, or (2) When a fair ball touches an umpire on fair                     territory before passing a fielder.<br />
                      (d) Spectator interference occurs when a spectator reaches out                     of the stands, or goes on the playing field, and touches a                     live ball. On any interference the ball is dead.<br />

                      <strong>THE LEAGUE</strong> is a group of clubs whose teams play each other in                     a pre arranged schedule under these rules for the league                     championship.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>THE LEAGUE PRESIDENT</strong> shall enforce the official rules, resolve                     any disputes involving the rules, and determine any protested                     games. The league president may fine or suspend any player,                     coach, manager or umpire for violation of these rules, at his                     discretion.<br />
                      <strong><br />
                        LEGAL (or LEGALLY) is in accordance with these rules.<br />
                        </strong><br />
                      <strong>A LIVE BALL</strong> is a ball which is in play.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>A LINE DRIVE</strong> is a batted ball that goes sharp and direct from                     the bat to a fielder without touching the ground.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>THE MANAGER</strong> is a person appointed by the club to be                     responsible for the team's actions on the field, and to                     represent the team in communications with the umpire and the                     opposing team. A player may be appointed manager.<br />
                      (a) The club shall designate the manager to the league                     president or the umpire in chief not less than thirty minutes                     before the scheduled starting time of the game.<br />
                      (b) The manager may advise the umpire that he has delegated                     specific duties prescribed by the rules to a player or coach,                     and any action of such designated representative shall be                     official. The manager shall always be responsible for his                     team's conduct, observance of the official rules, and                     deference to the umpires.<br />
                      (c) If a manager leaves the field, he shall designate a player                     or coach as his substitute, and such substitute manager shall                     have the duties, rights and responsibilities of the manager.                     If the manager fails or refuses to designate his substitute                     before leaving, the umpire in chief shall designate a team                     member as substitute manager.<br />
                      <strong><br />
                        OBSTRUCTION </strong>is the act of a fielder who, while not in                     possession of the ball and not in the act of fielding the                     ball, impedes the progress of any runner. If a fielder is                     about to receive a thrown ball and if the ball is in flight                     directly toward and near enough to the fielder so he must                     occupy his position to receive the ball he may be considered                     &quot;in the act of fielding a ball.&quot; It is entirely up to the                     judgment of the umpire as to whether a fielder is in the act                     of fielding a ball. After a fielder has made an attempt to                     field a ball and missed, he can no longer be in the &quot;act of                     fielding&quot; the ball. For example: an infielder dives at a                     ground ball and the ball passes him and he continues to lie on                     the ground and delays the progress of the runner, he very                     likely has obstructed the runner.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>OFFENSE </strong>is the team, or any player of the team, at bat.<br />

                      <br />
                      <strong>An OUTFIELDER</strong> is a fielder who occupies a position in the                     outfield, which is the area of the playing field most distant                     from home base.<br />

                      <strong>OVERSLIDE (or OVERSLIDING) </strong>is the act of an offensive player                     when his slide to a base, other than when advancing from home                     to first base, is with such momentum that he loses contact                     with the base.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>A PENALTY</strong> is the application of these rules following an                     illegal act.<br />

                      <strong>&quot;PLAY&quot;</strong> is the umpire's order to start the game or to resume                     action following any dead ball.<br />
                      <strong><br />
                        A QUICK RETURN</strong> pitch is one made with obvious intent to catch                     a batter off balance. It is an illegal pitch.<br />

                      <strong>SET POSITION </strong>is one of the two legal pitching positions.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>SQUEEZE PLAY </strong>is a term to designate a play when a team, with a                     runner on third base, attempts to score that runner by means                     of a bunt.<br />
