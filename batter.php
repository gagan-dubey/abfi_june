<h3 class="heading3070">6.00 The Batter</h3>
<p class="depart_p">

                            <strong>6.01</strong><br />
                      (a) Each player of the offensive team shall bat in the order that his name appears in his team's batting order.<br />
                      (b) The first batter in each inning after the first inning shall be the  player whose name follows that of the last player who legally completed  his time at bat in the preceding inning.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>6.02</strong><br />
                      (a) The batter shall take his position in the batter's box promptly when it is his time at bat.<br />
                      (b) The batter shall not leave his position in the batter's box after the pitcher comes to Set Position, or starts his windup. <br />
                      <br />
                      <strong> PENALTY</strong>: If the pitcher pitches, the umpire shall  call &quot;Ball&quot; or &quot;Strike,&quot; as the case may be. The batter leaves the  batter's box at the risk of having a strike delivered and called,  unless he requests the umpire to call &quot;Time.&quot; The batter is not at  liberty to step in and out of the batter's box at will. Once a batter  has taken his position in the batter's box, he shall not be permitted  to step out of the batter's box in order to use the resin or the pine  tar rag, unless there is a delay in the game action or, in the judgment  of the umpires, weather conditions warrant an exception. Umpires will  not call &quot;Time&quot; at the request of the batter or any member of his team  once the pitcher has started his windup or has come to a set position  even though the batter claims &quot;dust in his eyes,&quot; &quot;steamed glasses,&quot;  &quot;didn't get the sign&quot; or for any other cause. Umpires may grant a  hitter's request for &quot;Time&quot; once he is in the batter's box, but the  umpire should eliminate hitters walking out of the batter's box without  reason. If umpires are not lenient, batters will understand that they  are in the batter's box and they must remain there until the ball is  pitched. If pitcher delays once the batter is in his box and the umpire  feels that the delay is not justified he may allow the batter to step  out of the box momentarily. If after the pitcher starts his windup or  comes to a &quot;set position&quot; with a runner on, he does not go through with  his pitch because the batter has stepped out of the box, it shall not  be called a balk. Both the pitcher and batter have violated a rule and  the umpire shall call time and both the batter and pitcher start over  from &quot;scratch.&quot; <br />
                      (c) If the batter refuses to take his position in the batter's box  during his time at bat, the umpire shall order the pitcher to pitch,  and shall call &quot;Strike&quot; on each such pitch. The batter may take his  proper position after any such pitch, and the regular ball and strike  count shall continue, but if he does not take his proper position  before three strikes are called, he shall be declared out. <br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>6.03</strong><br />
                      The batter's legal position shall be with both feet within the batter's box.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong> APPROVED RULING:</strong> The lines defining the box are within the batter's box.    6.04  A batter has legally completed his time at bat when he is put out or becomes a runner.    6.05  A batter is out when_<br />
                      <br />
                      (a) His fair or foul fly ball (other than a foul tip) is legally caught by a fielder;<br />
                      (b) A third strike is legally caught by the catcher; &quot;Legally caught&quot;  means in the catcher's glove before the ball touches the ground. It is  not legal if the ball lodges in his clothing or paraphernalia; or if it  touches the umpire and is caught by the catcher on the rebound. If a  foul tip first strikes the catcher's glove and then goes on through and  is caught by both hands against his body or protector, before the ball  touches the ground, it is a strike, and if third strike, batter is out.  If smothered against his body or protector, it is a catch provided the  ball struck the catcher's glove or hand first. <br />
                      (c) A third strike is not caught by the catcher when first base is occupied before two are out;<br />
                      (d) He bunts foul on third strike; <br />
                      (e) An Infield Fly is declared;<br />
                      (f) He attempts to hit a third strike and the ball touches him;<br />
                      (g) His fair ball touches him before touching a fielder;<br />
                      (h) After hitting or bunting a fair ball, his bat hits the ball a  second time in fair territory. The ball is dead and no runners may  advance. If the batter runner drops his bat and the ball rolls against  the bat in fair territory and, in the umpire's judgment, there was no  intention to interfere with the course of the ball, the ball is alive  and in play; If a bat breaks and part of it is in fair territory and is  hit by a batted ball or part of it hits a runner or fielder, play shall  continue and no interference called. If batted ball hits part of broken  bat in foul territory, it is a foul ball. If a whole bat is thrown into  fair territory and interferes with a defensive player attempting to  make a play, interference shall be called, whether intentional or not.  In cases where the batting helmet is accidentally hit with a batted or  thrown ball, the ball remains in play the same as if it has not hit the  helmet. If a batted ball strikes a batting helmet or any other object  foreign to the natural ground while on foul territory, it is a foul  ball and the ball is dead. If, in the umpire's judgment, there is  intent on the part of a baserunner to interfere with a batted or thrown  ball by dropping the helmet or throwing it at the ball, then the runner  would be out, the ball dead and runners would return to last base  legally touched.<br />
                      (i) After hitting or bunting a foul ball, he intentionally deflects the  course of the ball in any manner while running to first base. The ball  is dead and no runners may advance;<br />
                      (j) After a third strike or after he hits a fair ball, he or first base is tagged before he touches first base; <br />
                      (k) In running the last half of the distance from home base to first  base, while the ball is being fielded to first base, he runs outside  (to the right of) the three foot line, or inside (to the left of) the  foul line, and in the umpire's judgment in so doing interferes with the  fielder taking the throw at first base; except that he may run outside  (to the right of) the three foot line or inside (to the left of) the  foul line to avoid a fielder attempting to field a batted ball;<br />
                      (l) An infielder intentionally drops a fair fly ball or line drive,  with first, first and second, first and third, or first, second and  third base occupied before two are out. The ball is dead and runner or  runners shall return to their original base or bases; APPROVED RULING:  In this situation, the batter is not out if the infielder permits the  ball to drop untouched to the ground, except when the Infield Fly rule  applies. <br />
                      (m)A preceding runner shall, in the umpire's judgment, intentionally  interfere with a fielder who is attempting to catch a thrown ball or to  throw a ball in an attempt to complete any play: The objective of this  rule is to penalize the offensive team for deliberate, unwarranted,  unsportsmanlike action by the runner in leaving the baseline for the  obvious purpose of crashing the pivot man on a double play, rather than  trying to reach the base. Obviously this is an umpire's judgment play.<br />
                      (n) With two out, a runner on third base, and two strikes on the  batter, the runner attempts to steal home base on a legal pitch and the  ball touches the runner in the batter's strike zone. The umpire shall  call &quot;Strike Three,&quot; the batter is out and the run shall not count;  before two are out, the umpire shall call &quot;Strike Three,&quot; the ball is  dead, and the run counts.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>6.06</strong><br />
                      A batter is out for illegal action when_ <br />
                      <br />
                      (a) He hits a ball with one or both feet on the ground entirely outside  the batter's box. If a batter hits a ball fair or foul while out of the  batter's box, he shall be called out. Umpires should pay particular  attention to the position of the batter's feet if he attempts to hit  the ball while he is being intentionally passed. A batter cannot jump  or step out of the batter's box and hit the ball.<br />
                      (b) He steps from one batter's box to the other while the pitcher is in position ready to pitch;<br />
                      (c) He interferes with the catcher's fielding or throwing by stepping  out of the batter's box or making any other movement that hinders the  catcher's play at home base. <br />
                      <br />
                      <strong> EXCEPTION:</strong> Batter is not out if any runner attempting  to advance is put out, or if runner trying to score is called out for  batter's interference. If the batter interferes with the catcher, the  plate umpire shall call &quot;interference.&quot; The batter is out and the ball  dead. No player may advance on such interference (offensive  interference) and all runners must return to the last base that was, in  the judgment of the umpire, legally touched at the time of the  interference. If, however, the catcher makes a play and the runner  attempting to advance is put out, it is to be assumed there was no  actual interference and that runner is out not the batter. Any other  runners on the base at the time may advance as the ruling is that there  is no actual interference if a runner is retired. In that case play  proceeds just as if no violation had been called. If a batter strikes  at a ball and misses and swings so hard he carries the bat all the way  around and, in the umpire's judgment, unintentionally hits the catcher  or the ball in back of him on the backswing before the catcher has  securely held the ball, it shall be called a strike only (not  interference). The ball will be dead, however, and no runner shall  advance on the play.<br />
                      (d) He uses or attempts to use a bat that, in  the umpire's judgment, has been altered or tampered with in such a way  to improve the distance factor or cause an unusual reaction on the  baseball. This includes, bats that are filled, flat surfaced, nailed,  hollowed, grooved or covered with a substance such as paraffin, wax,  etc. No advancement on the bases will be allowed and any out or outs  made during a play shall stand. In addition to being called out, the  player shall be ejected from the game and may be subject to additional  penalties as determined by his League President. <br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>6.07  BATTING OUT OF TURN. </strong><br />
                      <br />
                      (a) A batter shall be called out, on appeal, when he fails to bat  in his proper turn, and another batter completes a time at bat in his  place. (1) The proper batter may take his place in the batter's box at  any time before the improper batter becomes a runner or is put out, and  any balls and strikes shall be counted in the proper batter's time at  bat.<br />
                      (b) When an improper batter becomes a runner or is put out, and the  defensive team appeals to the umpire before the first pitch to the next  batter of either team, or before any play or attempted play, the umpire  shall<br />
                      (1) declare the proper batter out; and <br />
                      (2) nullify any advance or score made because of a ball batted by the  improper batter or because of the improper batter's advance to first  base on a hit, an error, a base on balls, a hit batter or otherwise. <br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>NOTE:</strong> If a runner advances, while the improper batter  is at bat, on a stolen base, balk, wild pitch or passed ball, such  advance is legal. <br />
                      (c) When an improper batter becomes a runner or is put out, and a pitch  is made to the next batter of either team before an appeal is made, the  improper batter thereby becomes the proper batter, and the results of  his time at bat become legal. <br />
                      (d)<br />
                      (1) When the proper batter is called out because he has failed to bat  in turn, the next batter shall be the batter whose name follows that of  the proper batter thus called out;<br />
                      (2) When an improper batter becomes a proper batter because no appeal  is made before the next pitch, the next batter shall be the batter  whose name follows that of such legalized improper batter. The instant  an improper batter's actions are legalized, the batting order picks up  with the name following that of the legalized improper batter. The  umpire shall not direct the attention of any person to the presence in  the batter's box of an improper batter. This rule is designed to  require constant vigilance by the players and managers of both teams.  There are two fundamentals to keep in mind: When a player bats out of  turn, the proper batter is the player called out. If an improper batter  bats and reaches base or is out and no appeal is made before a pitch to  the next batter, or before any play or attempted play, that improper  batter is considered to have batted in proper turn and establishes the  order that is to follow. <br />
                      <br />
                      APPROVED RULING To illustrate various situations arising from batting  out of turn, assume a first inning batting order as follows: Abel Baker  Charles Daniel Edward Frank George Hooker Irwin. PLAY <br />
                      (1). Baker bats. With the count 2 balls and 1 strike, <br />
                      (a) the offensive team discovers the error or <br />
                      (b) the defensive team appeals. RULING: In either case, Abel replaces  Baker, with the count on him 2 balls and 1 strike. PLAY (2). Baker bats  and doubles. The defensive team appeals<br />
                      (a) immediately or <br />
                      (b) after a pitch to Charles. <br />
                      <br />
                      <strong> RULING: </strong><br />
                      (a) Abel is called out and Baker is the proper batter; <br />
                      (b) Baker stays on second and Charles is the proper batter. <br />
                      PLAY (3). Abel walks. Baker walks. Charles forces Baker. Edward bats in  Daniel's turn. While Edward is at bat, Abel scores and Charles goes to  second on a wild pitch. Edward grounds out, sending Charles to third.  The defensive team appeals <br />
                      (a) immediately or <br />
                      (b) after a pitch to Daniel. <br />
                      <br />
                      <strong> RULING:</strong><br />
                      (a) Abel's run counts and Charles is  entitled to second base since these advances were not made because of  the improper batter batting a ball or advancing to first base. Charles  must return to second base because his advance to third resulted from  the improper batter batting a ball. Daniel is called out, and Edward is  the proper batter; <br />
                      (b) Abel's run counts and Charles stays on third. The proper batter is Frank. <br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>PLAY (4).</strong> With the bases full and two out. Hooker bats in Frank's turn, and triples, scoring three runs. The defensive team appeals <br />
                      (a) immediately, or<br />
                      (b) after a pitch to George.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>RULING: </strong><br />
                      (a) Frank is called out and no runs score. George is the proper batter to lead off the second inning; <br />
                      (b) Hooker stays on third and three runs score. Irwin is the proper batter. <br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>PLAY (5).</strong><br />
                      After Play (4) (b) above, George continues at bat.<br />
                      (a) Hooker is picked off third base for the third out, or <br />
                      (b) George flies out, and no appeal is made. Who is the proper leadoff batter in the second inning? <br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>RULING: </strong><br />
                      (a) Irwin. He became the proper batter as soon as the first pitch to George legalized Hooker's triple;<br />
                      (b) Hooker. When no appeal was made, the first pitch to the leadoff batter of the opposing team legalized George's time at bat. <br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>PLAY (6).</strong> <br />
                      Daniel walks and Abel comes to bat. Daniel was an improper batter, and  if an appeal is made before the first pitch to Abel, Abel is out,  Daniel is removed from base, and Baker is the proper batter. There is  no appeal, and a pitch is made to Abel. Daniel's walk is now legalized,  and Edward thereby becomes the proper batter. Edward can replace Abel  at any time before Abel is put out or becomes a runner. He does not do  so. Abel flies out, and Baker comes to bat. Abel was an improper  batter, and if an appeal is made before the first pitch to Baker,  Edward is out, and the proper batter is Frank. There is no appeal, and  a pitch is made to Baker. Abel's out is now legalized, and the proper  batter is Baker. Baker walks. Charles is the proper batter. Charles  flies out. Now Daniel is the proper batter, but he is on second base.  Who is the proper batter?<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>RULING: </strong><br />
                      The proper batter is Edward. When the proper batter is on base, he is  passed over, and the following batter becomes the proper batter <br />
                      <strong><br />
                        6.08</strong><br />
                      The batter becomes a runner and is  entitled to first base without liability to be put out (provided he  advances to and touches first base) when_ <br />
                      (a) Four &quot;balls&quot; have been called by the umpire; A batter who is  entitled to first base because of a base on balls must go to first base  and touch the base before other base runners are forced to advance.  This applies when bases are full and applies when a substitute runner  is put into the game. If, in advancing, the base runner thinks there is  a play and he slides past the base before or after touching it he may  be put out by the fielder tagging him. If he fails to touch the base to  which he is entitled and attempts to advance beyond that base he may be  put out by tagging him or the base he missed.<br />
                      (b) He is touched by a pitched ball which he is not attempting to hit unless<br />
                      (1) The ball is in the strike zone when it touches the batter, or<br />
                      (2) The batter makes no attempt to avoid being touched by the ball; If  the ball is in the strike zone when it touches the batter, it shall be  called a strike, whether or not the batter tries to avoid the ball. If  the ball is outside the strike zone when it touches the batter, it  shall be called a ball if he makes no attempt to avoid being touched.  APPROVED RULING: When the batter is touched by a pitched ball which  does not entitle him to first base, the ball is dead and no runner may  advance. <br />
                      (c) The catcher or any fielder interferes with him. If a play follows  the interference, the manager of the offense may advise the plate  umpire that he elects to decline the interference penalty and accept  the play. Such election shall be made immediately at the end of the  play. However, if the batter reaches first base on a hit, an error, a  base on balls, a hit batsman, or otherwise, and all other runners  advance at least one base, the play proceeds without reference to the  interference. If catcher's interference is called with a play in  progress the umpire will allow the play to continue because the manager  may elect to take the play. If the batter runner missed first base, or  a runner misses his next base, he shall be considered as having reached  the base, as stated in Note of Rule 7.04<br />
                      (d). Examples of plays the manager might elect to take:<br />
                      1. Runner on third, one out, batter hits fly ball to the outfield on  which the runner scores but catcher's interference was called. The  offensive manager may elect to take the run and have batter called out  or have runner remain at third and batter awarded first base. <br />
                      2. Runner on second base. Catcher interferes with batter as he bunts  ball fairly sending runner to third base. The manager may rather have  runner on third base with an out on the play than have runners on  second and first. In situations where the manager wants the  &quot;interference&quot; penalty to apply, the following interpretation shall be  made of 6.08 <br />
                      (c): If the catcher (or any fielder) interferes with the batter, the  batter is awarded first base. If, on such interference a runner is  trying to score by a steal or squeeze from third base, the ball is dead  and the runner on third scores and batter is awarded first base. If the  catcher interferes with the batter with no runners trying to score from  third on a squeeze or steal, then the ball is dead, batter is awarded  first base and runners who are forced to advance, do advance. Runners  not attempting to steal or not forced to advance remain on the base  they occupied at the time of the interference. If the catcher  interferes with the batter before the pitcher delivers the ball, it  shall not be considered interference on the batter under Rule 6.08 (c).  In such cases, the umpire shall call &quot;Time&quot; and the pitcher and batter  start over from &quot;scratch.&quot; <br />
                      (d) A fair ball touches an umpire or a runner on fair territory before  touching a fielder. If a fair ball touches an umpire after having  passed a fielder other than the pitcher, or having touched a fielder,  including the pitcher, the ball is in play. <br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>6.09</strong><br />
                      The batter becomes a runner when_ <br />
                      <br />
                      (a) He hits a fair ball;<br />
                      (b) The third strike called by the umpire is not caught, providing <br />
                      (1) first base is unoccupied, or <br />
                      (2)  first base is occupied with two out; When a batter becomes a base  runner on a third strike not caught by the catcher and starts for the  dugout, or his position, and then realizes his situation and attempts  then to reach first base, he is not out unless he or first base is  tagged before he reaches first base. If, however, he actually reaches  the dugout or dugout steps, he may not then attempt to go to first base  and shall be out.<br />
                      (c) A fair ball, after having passed a fielder other than the pitcher,  or after having been touched by a fielder, including the pitcher, shall  touch an umpire or runner on fair territory;<br />
                      (d) A fair ball passes over a fence or into the stands at a distance  from home base of 250 feet or more. Such hit entitles the batter to a  home run when he shall have touched all bases legally. A fair fly ball  that passes out of the playing field at a point less than 250 feet from  home base shall entitle the batter to advance to second base only;<br />
                      (e) A fair ball, after touching the ground, bounds into the stands, or  passes through, over or under a fence, or through or under a  scoreboard, or through or under shrubbery, or vines on the fence, in  which case the batter and the runners shall be entitled to advance two  bases; <br />
                      (f) Any fair ball which, either before or after touching the ground,  passes through or under a fence, or through or under a scoreboard, or  through any opening in the fence or scoreboard, or through or under  shrubbery, or vines on the fence, or which sticks in a fence or  scoreboard, in which case the batter and the runners shall be entitled  to two bases; <br />
                      (g) Any bounding fair ball is deflected by the fielder into the stands,  or over or under a fence on fair or foul territory, in which case the  batter and all runners shall be entitled to advance two bases;<br />
                      (h) Any fair fly ball is deflected by the fielder into the stands, or  over the fence into foul territory, in which case the batter shall be  entitled to advance to second base; but if deflected into the stands or  over the fence in fair territory, the batter shall be entitled to a  home run. However, should such a fair fly be deflected at a point less  than 250 feet from home plate, the batter shall be entitled to two  bases only.<br />

                      <strong>6.10</strong><br />
                      Any League may elect to use the Designated Hitter Rule.<br />
                      <br />
                      (a) In the event of inter league competition between clubs of  Leagues using the Designated Hitter Rule and clubs of Leagues not using  the Designated Hitter Rule, the rule will be used as follows: <br />
                      <br />
                      1. In World Series or exhibition games, the rule will be used or not used as is the practice of the home team. <br />
                      2. In All Star games, the rule will only be used if both teams and both Leagues so agree.<br />
                      <br />
                      (b) The Rule provides as follows: A hitter may be designated to  bat for the starting pitcher and all subsequent pitchers in any game  without otherwise affecting the status of the pitcher(s) in the game. A  Designated Hitter for the pitcher must be selected prior to the game  and must be included in the lineup cards presented to the Umpire in  Chief. The designated hitter named in the starting lineup must come to  bat at least one time, unless the opposing club changes pitchers. It is  not mandatory that a club designate a hitter for the pitcher, but  failure to do so prior to the game precludes the use of a Designated  Hitter for that game. Pinch hitters for a Designated Hitter may be  used. Any substitute hitter for a Designated Hitter becomes the  Designated Hitter. A replaced Designated Hitter shall not re enter the  game in any capacity. The Designated Hitter may be used defensively,  continuing to bat in the same position in the batting order, but the  pitcher must then bat in the place of the substituted defensive player,  unless more than one substitution is made, and the manager then must  designate their spots in the batting order. A runner may be substituted  for the Designated Hitter and the runner assumes the role of Designated  Hitter. A Designated Hitter may not pinch run. A Designated Hitter is  &quot;locked&quot; into the batting order. No multiple substitutions may be made  that will alter the batting rotation of the Designated Hitter. Once the  game pitcher is switched from the mound to a defensive position this  move shall terminate the Designated Hitter role for the remainder of  the game. Once a pinch hitter bats for any player in the batting order  and then enters the game to pitch, this move shall terminate the  Designated Hitter role for the remainder of the game. Once the game  pitcher bats for the Designated Hitter this move shall terminate the  Designated Hitter role for the remainder of the game. (The game pitcher  may only pinch hit for the Designated Hitter). Once a Designated Hitter  assumes a defensive position this move shall terminate the Designated  Hitter role for the remainder of the game. A substitute for the  Designated Hitter need not be announced until it is the Designated  Hitter's turn to bat.
