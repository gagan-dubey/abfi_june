                            Baseball is a game between two teams of nine players each, under direction of a manager, played on an enclosed field in accordance with these rules, under jurisdiction of one or more umpires.
                              <br /><br /><strong> 1.02</strong><br />
                                The objective of each team is to win by scoring more runs than the opponent.
                           <br /><br /> <strong> 1.03</strong><br />
                              The winner of the game shall be that team which shall have scored, in accordance with these rules, the greater number of runs at the conclusion of a regulation game.
                           <br /><br /><strong> 1.04</strong><br />
                              THE PLAYING FIELD. The field shall be laid out according to the instructions below, supplemented by Diagrams No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3. The infield shall be a 90 foot square. The outfield shall be the area between two foul lines formed by extending two sides of the square, as in Diagram 1. The distance from home base to the nearest fence, stand or other obstruction on fair territory shall be 250 feet or more. A distance of 320 feet or more along the foul lines, and 400 feet or more to center field is preferable. The infield shall be graded so                     that the base lines and home plate are level. The pitcher's plate shall be 10 inches above the level of home plate. The degree of slope from a point 6 inches in front of the pitcher's plate to a point 6 feet toward home plate shall be 1 inch to 1 foot, and such degree of slope shall be uniform. The infield and outfield, including the boundary lines, are fair territory and all other area is foul territory. It is desirable that the line from home base through the pitchers plate to second base shall run East Northeast. It is recommended that the distance from home base to the backstop, and from the base lines to the nearest fence, stand or other obstruction on foul territory shall be 60 feet or more. See                     Diagram 1. When location of home base is determined, with a                     steel tape measure 127 feet, 3 3/8 inches in desired direction                     to establish second base. From home base, measure 90 feet                     toward first base; from second base, measure 90 feet toward first base; the intersection of these lines establishes first base. From home base, measure 90 feet toward third base; from second base, measure 90 feet toward third base; the intersection of these lines establishes third base. The distance between first base and third base is 127 feet, 3 3/8 inches. All measurements from home base shall be taken from the point where the first and third base lines intersect. The catcher's box, the batters' boxes, the coaches' boxes, the three foot first base lines and the next batter's boxes shall be laid out as shown in Diagrams 1 and 2. The foul lines and all other playing lines indicated in the diagrams by solid black lines shall be marked with wet, unslaked lime, chalk or other white material. The grass lines and dimensions shown on the diagrams are those used in many fields, but they are not mandatory and each club shall determine the size and shape of the grassed and bare areas of its playing field. NOTE (a) Any Playing Field constructed by a professional club after June 1,1958, shall provide a minimum distance of 325 feet from home base to the nearest fence, stand or other obstruction on the right and left field foul lines, and a minimum distance of 400 feet to the center field fence. (b) No existing playing field shall be remodeled after June 1, 1958, in such manner as to reduce the distance from home base to the foul poles and to the center field fence below the minimum specified in paragraph (a) above.

The tool or measuring tape shall be placed to contact the                   surface or feature of item being measured and follow all                   contours in the process. The glove shall not measure more than                   12'' from the tip of any one of the 4 fingers, through the ball                   pocket to the bottom edge or heel of glove. The glove shall not                   measure more than 7 3/4'' wide, measured from the inside seam at                   base of first finger, along base of other fingers, to the                   outside edge of little finger edge of glove. The space or area                   between the thumb and first finger, called crotch, may be filled                   with leather webbing or back stop. The webbing may be                   constructed of two plies of standard leather to close the crotch                   area entirely, or it may be constructed of a series of tunnels                   made of leather, or a series of panels of leather, or of lacing                   leather thongs. The webbing may not be constructed of wound or                   wrapped lacing to make a net type of trap. When webbing is made                   to cover entire crotch area, the webbing can be constructed so                   as to be flexible. When constructed of a series of sections,                   they must be joined together. These sections may not be so                   constructed to allow depression to be developed by curvatures in                   the section sides. The webbing shall be made to control the size                   of the crotch opening. The crotch opening shall measure not more                   than 4 1/2'' at the top, not more than 5 3/4'' deep, and shall                   be 3 1/2'' wide at its bottom. The opening of crotch shall not                   be more than 4 1/2'' at any point below its top. The webbing                   shall be secured at each side, and at top and bottom of crotch.                   The attachment to be made with leather lacing, these connections                   to be secured. If they stretch or become loose, they shall be                   adjusted to their proper condition. The glove can be of any                   weight.<br />
