									<strong>9.01</strong><br />
							  (a) The league president shall appoint one or more umpires to officiate  at each league championship game. The umpires shall be responsible for  the conduct of the game in accordance with these official rules and for  maintaining discipline and order on the playing field during the game. <br />
							  (b) Each umpire is the representative of the league and of professional  baseball, and is authorized and required to enforce all of these rules.  Each umpire has authority to order a player, coach, manager or club  officer or employee to do or refrain from doing anything which affects  the administering of these rules, and to enforce the prescribed  penalties. <br />
							  (c) Each umpire has authority to rule on any point not specifically covered in these rules.<br />
							  (d) Each umpire has authority to disqualify any player, coach, manager  or substitute for objecting to decisions or for unsportsmanlike conduct  or language, and to eject such disqualified person from the playing  field. If an umpire disqualifies a player while a play is in progress,  the disqualification shall not take effect until no further action is  possible in that play.<br />
							  (e) Each umpire has authority at his discretion to eject from the playing field <br />
							  (1) any person whose duties permit his presence on the field, such as  ground crew members, ushers, photographers, newsmen, broadcasting crew  members, etc., and<br />
							  (2) any spectator or other person not authorized to be on the playing field. <br />
							  <br />
							  <strong>9.02</strong><br />
							  (a) Any umpire's decision which involves judgment, such as, but not  limited to, whether a batted ball is fair or foul, whether a pitch is a  strike or a ball, or whether a runner is safe or out, is final. No  player, manager, coach or substitute shall object to any such judgment  decisions.<br />
							  (a) Players leaving their position in the field or on base, or managers  or coaches leaving the bench or coaches box, to argue on BALLS AND  STRIKES will not be permitted. They should be warned if they start for  the plate to protest the call. If they continue, they will be ejected  from the game.<br />
							  (b) If there is reasonable doubt that any umpire's decision may be in  conflict with the rules, the manager may appeal the decision and ask  that a correct ruling be made. Such appeal shall be made only to the  umpire who made the protested decision. <br />
							  (c) If a decision is appealed, the umpire making the decision may ask  another umpire for information before making a final decision. No  umpire shall criticize, seek to reverse or interfere with another  umpire's decision unless asked to do so by the umpire making it. (c)  The manager or the catcher may request the plate umpire to ask his  partner for help on a half swing when the plate umpire calls the pitch  a ball, but not when the pitch is called a strike. The manager may not  complain that the umpire made an improper call, but only that he did  not ask his partner for help. Field umpires must be alerted to the  request from the plate umpire and quickly respond. Managers may not  protest the call of a ball or strike on the pretense they are asking  for information about a half swing. Appeals on a half swing may be made  only on the call of ball and when asked to appeal, the home plate  umpire must refer to a base umpire for his judgment on the half swing.  Should the base umpire call the pitch a strike, the strike call shall  prevail. Baserunners must be alert to the possibility that the base  umpire on appeal from the plate umpire may reverse the call of a ball  to the call of a strike, in which event the runner is in jeopardy of  being out by the catcher's throw. Also, a catcher must be alert in a  base stealing situation if a ball call is reversed to a strike by the  base umpire upon appeal from the plate umpire. The ball is in play on  appeal on a half swing. On a half swing, if the manager comes out to  argue with first or third base umpire and if after being warned he  persists in arguing, he can be ejected as he is now arguing over a  called ball or strike.<br />
							  (d) No umpire may be replaced during a game unless he is injured or becomes ill.<br />
							  <br />
							  <strong>9.03</strong><br />
							  (a) If there is only one umpire, he shall have complete jurisdiction in  administering the rules. He may take any position on the playing field  which will enable him to discharge his duties (usually) behind the  catcher, but sometimes behind the pitcher if there are runners). <br />
							  (b) If there are two or more umpires, one shall be designated umpire in chief and the others field umpires.<br />
							  <br />
							  <strong>9.04</strong><br />
							  (a) The umpire in chief shall stand behind the catcher. (He usually is called the plate umpire.) His duties shall be to: <br />
							  (1) Take full charge of, and be responsible for, the proper conduct of the game; <br />
							  (2) Call and count balls and strike;<br />
							  (3) Call and declare fair balls and fouls except those commonly called by field umpires;<br />
							  (4) Make all decisions on the batter;<br />
							  (5) Make all decisions except those commonly reserved for the field umpires; <br />
							  (6) Decide when a game shall be forfeited; <br />
							  (7) If a time limit has been set, announce the fact and the time set before the game starts; <br />
							  (8) Inform the official scorer of the official batting order, and any changes in the lineups and batting order, on request;<br />
							  (9) Announce any special ground rules, at his discretion. <br />
							  <br />
							  (b) A field umpire may take any position on the playing field he thinks  best suited to make impending decisions on the bases. His duties shall  be to:<br />
							  (1) Make all decisions on the bases except those specifically reserved to the umpire in chief; <br />
							  (2) Take concurrent jurisdiction with the umpire in chief in calling  &quot;Time,&quot; balks, illegal pitches, or defacement or discoloration of the  ball by any player. <br />
							  (3) Aid the umpire in chief in every manner in enforcing the rules, and  excepting the power to forfeit the game, shall have equal authority  with the umpire in chief in administering and enforcing the rules and  maintaining discipline.<br />
							  <br />
							  (c) If different decisions should be made on one play by different  umpires, the umpire in chief shall call all the umpires into  consultation, with no manager or player present. After consultation,  the umpire in chief (unless another umpire may have been designated by  the league president) shall determine which decision shall prevail,  based on which umpire was in best position and which decision was most  likely correct. Play shall proceed as if only the final decision had  been made. <br />
							  <br />
							  <strong>9.05</strong><br />
							  (a) The umpire shall report to the league  president within twelve hours after the end of a game all violations of  rules and other incidents worthy of comment, including the  disqualification of any trainer, manager, coach or player, and the  reasons therefor. <br />
							  (b) When any trainer, manager, coach or player is disqualified for a  flagrant offense such as the use of obscene or indecent language, or an  assault upon an umpire, trainer, manager, coach or player, the umpire  shall forward full particulars to the league president within four  hours after the end of the game. <br />
							  (c) After receiving the umpire's report that a trainer, manager, coach  or player has been disqualified, the league president shall impose such  penalty as he deems justified, and shall notify the person penalized  and the manager of the club of which the penalized person is a member.  If the penalty includes a fine, the penalized person shall pay the  amount of the fine to the league within five days after receiving  notice of the fine. Failure to pay such fine within five days shall  result in the offender being debarred from participation in any game  and from sitting on the players' bench during any game, until the fine  is paid. <br />
							  <br />
							  GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS TO UMPIRE Umpires, on the field, should not  indulge in conversation with players. Keep out of the coaching box and  do not talk to the coach on duty. Keep your uniform in good condition.  Be active and alert on the field. Be courteous, always, to club  officials; avoid visiting in club offices and thoughtless familiarity  with officers or employees of contesting clubs. When you enter a ball  park your sole duty is to umpire a ball game as the representative of  baseball. Do not allow criticism to keep you from studying out bad  situations that may lead to protested games. Carry your rule book. It  is better to consult the rules and hold up the game ten minutes to  decide a knotty problem than to have a game thrown out on protest and  replayed. Keep the game moving. A ball game is often helped by  energetic and earnest work of the umpires. You are the only official  representative of baseball on the ball field. It is often a trying  position which requires the exercise of much patience and good  judgment, but do not forget that the first essential in working out of  a bad situation is to keep your own temper and self control. You no  doubt are going to make mistakes, but never attempt to &quot;even up&quot; after  having made one. Make all decisions as you see them and forget which is  the home or visiting club. Keep your eye everlastingly on the ball  while it is in play. It is more vital to know just where a fly ball  fell, or a thrown ball finished up, than whether or not a runner missed  a base. Do not call the plays too quickly, or turn away too fast when a  fielder is throwing to complete a double play. Watch out for dropped  balls after you have called a man out. Do not come running with your  arm up or down, denoting &quot;out&quot; or &quot;safe.&quot; Wait until the play is  completed before making any arm motion. Each umpire team should work  out a simple set of signals, so the proper umpire can always right a  manifestly wrong decision when convinced he has made an error. If sure  you got the play correctly, do not be stampeded by players' appeals to  &quot;ask the other man.&quot; If not sure, ask one of your associates. Do not  carry this to extremes, be alert and get your own plays. But remember!  The first requisite is to get decisions correctly. If in doubt don't  hesitate to consult your associate. Umpire dignity is important but  never as important as &quot;being right.&quot; A most important rule for umpires  is always &quot;BE IN POSITION TO SEE EVERY PLAY.&quot; Even though your decision  may be 100% right, players still question it if they feel you were not  in a spot to see the play clearly and definitely. Finally, be  courteous, impartial and firm, and so compel respect from all.
