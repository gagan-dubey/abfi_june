<p class="depart_p">

                        <strong>8.01</strong><br />
                          Legal pitching delivery. There are two legal pitching positions, the  Windup Position and the Set Position, and either position may be used  at any time. Pitchers shall take signs from the catcher while standing  on the rubber. Pitchers may disengage the rubber after taking their  signs but may not step quickly onto the rubber and pitch. This may be  judged a quick pitch by the umpire. When the pitcher disengages the  rubber, he must drop his hands to his sides. Pitchers will not be  allowed to disengage the rubber after taking each sign. (a) The Windup  Position. The pitcher shall stand facing the batter, his entire pivot  foot on, or in front of and touching and not off the end of the  pitcher's plate, and the other foot free. From this position any  natural movement associated with his delivery of the ball to the batter  commits him to the pitch without interruption or alteration. He shall  not raise either foot from the ground, except that in his actual  delivery of the ball to the batter, he may take one step backward, and  one step forward with his free foot. When a pitcher holds the ball with  both hands in front of his body, with his entire pivot foot on, or in  front of and touching but not off the end of the pitcher's plate, and  his other foot free, he will be considered in the Windup Position. The  pitcher may have one foot, not the pivot foot, off the rubber and any  distance he may desire back of a line which is an extension to the back  edge of the pitcher's plate, but not at either side of the pitcher's  plate. With his &quot;free&quot; foot the pitcher may take one step backward and  one step forward, but under no circumstances, to either side, that is  to either the first base or third base side of the pitcher's rubber. If  a pitcher holds the ball with both hands in front of his body, with his  entire pivot foot on or in front of and touching but not off the end of  the pitcher's plate, and his other foot free, he will be considered in  a windup position. From this position he may: (1) deliver the ball to  the batter, or (2) step and throw to a base in an attempt to pick off a  runner, or (3) disengage the rubber (if he does he must drop his hand  to his sides). In disengaging the rubber the pitcher must step off with  his pivot foot and not his free foot first. He may not go into a set or  stretch position if he does it is a balk. (b) The Set Position. Set  Position shall be indicated by the pitcher when he stands facing the  batter with his entire pivot foot on, or in front of, and in contact  with, and not off the end of the pitcher's plate, and his other foot in  front of the pitcher's plate, holding the ball in both hands in front  of his body and coming to a complete stop. From such Set Position he  may deliver the ball to the batter, throw to a base or step backward  off the pitcher's plate with his pivot foot. Before assuming Set  Position, the pitcher may elect to make any natural preliminary motion  such as that known as &quot;the stretch.&quot; But if he so elects, he shall come  to Set Position before delivering the ball to the batter. After  assuming Set Position, any natural motion associated with his delivery  of the ball to the batter commits him to the pitch without alteration  or interruption. Preparatory to coming to a set position, the pitcher  shall have one hand on his side; from this position he shall go to his  set position as defined in Rule 8.01 (b) without interruption and in  one continuous motion. The whole width of the foot in contact with the  rubber must be on the rubber. A pitcher cannot pitch from off the end  of the rubber with just the side of his foot touching the rubber. The  pitcher, following his stretch, must (a) hold the ball in both hands in  front of his body and (b) come to a complete stop. This must be  enforced. Umpires should watch this closely. Pitchers are constantly  attempting to &quot;beat the rule&quot; in their efforts to hold runners on bases  and in cases where the pitcher fails to make a complete &quot;stop&quot; called  for in the rules, the umpire should immediately call a &quot;Balk.&quot; (c) At  any time during the pitcher's preliminary movements and until his  natural pitching motion commits him to the pitch, he may throw to any  base provided he steps directly toward such base before making the  throw. The pitcher shall step &quot;ahead of the throw.&quot; A snap throw  followed by the step directly toward the base is a balk. (d) If the  pitcher makes an illegal pitch with the bases unoccupied, it shall be  called a ball unless the batter reaches first base on a hit, an error,  a base on balls, a hit batter or otherwise. A ball which slips out of a  pitcher's hand and crosses the foul line shall be called a ball;  otherwise it will be called no pitch. This would be a balk with men on  base. (e) If the pitcher removes his pivot foot from contact with the  pitcher's plate by stepping backward with that foot, he thereby becomes  an infielder and if he makes a wild throw from that position, it shall  be considered the same as a wild throw by any other infielder. The  pitcher, while off the rubber, may throw to any base. If he makes a  wild throw, such throw is the throw of an infielder and what follows is  governed by the rules covering a ball thrown by a fielder<br />
                          <br /><br />
                       
                      <strong>8.02</strong><br />
                        The pitcher shall not_ (a) (1) Bring his pitching hand in contact with  his mouth or lips while in the 18 foot circle surrounding the pitching  rubber. EXCEPTION: Provided it is agreed to by both managers, the  umpire prior to the start of a game played in cold weather, may permit  the pitcher to blow on his hand. PENALTY: For violation of this part of  this rule the umpires shall immediately call a ball. However, if the  pitch is made and a batter reaches first base on a hit, an error, a hit  batsman or otherwise, and no other runner is put out before advancing  at least one base, the play shall proceed without reference to the  violation. Repeated offenders shall be subject to a fine by the league  president. (2) Apply a foreign substance of any kind to the ball; (3)  expectorate on the ball, either hand or his glove; (4) rub the ball on  his glove, person or clothing; (5) deface the ball in any manner; (6)  deliver what is called the &quot;shine&quot; ball, &quot;spit&quot; ball, &quot;mud&quot; ball or  &quot;emery&quot; ball. The pitcher, of course, is allowed to rub the ball  between his bare hands. PENALTY: For violation of any part of this rule  8.02 (a) (2 to 6) the umpire shall: (a) Call the pitch a ball, warn the  pitcher and have announced on the public address system the reason for  the action. (b) In the case of a second offense by the same pitcher in  the same game, the pitcher shall be disqualified from the game. (c) If  a play follows the violation called by the umpire, the manager of the  offense may advise the plate umpire that he elects to accept the play.  Such election shall be made immediately at the end of the play.  However, if the batter reaches first base on a hit, an error, a base on  balls, a hit batsman, or otherwise, and no other runner is put out  before advancing at least one base, the play shall proceed without  reference to the violation. (d) Even though the offense elects to take  the play, the violation shall be recognized and the penalties in (a)  and (b) will still be in effect. (e) The umpire shall be sole judge on  whether any portion of this rule has been violated. All umpires shall  carry with them one official rosin bag. The umpire in chief is  responsible for placing the rosin bag on the ground back of the  pitcher's plate. If at any time the ball hits the rosin bag it is in  play. In the case of rain or wet field, the umpire may instruct the  pitcher to carry the rosin bag in his hip pocket. A pitcher may use the  rosin bag for the purpose of applying rosin to his bare hand or hands.  Neither the pitcher nor any other player shall dust the ball with the  rosin bag; neither shall the pitcher nor any other player be permitted  to apply rosin from the bag to his glove or dust any part of his  uniform with the rosin bag. (b) Have on his person, or in his  possession, any foreign substance. For such infraction of this section  (b) the penalty shall be immediate ejection from the game. (c)  Intentionally delay the game by throwing the ball to players other than  the catcher, when the batter is in position, except in an attempt to  retire a runner. PENALTY: If, after warning by the umpire, such  delaying action is repeated, the pitcher shall be removed from the  game. (d) Intentionally Pitch at the Batter. If, in the umpire's  judgment, such a violation occurs, the umpire may elect either to: 1.  Expel the pitcher, or the manager and the pitcher, from the game, or 2.  may warn the pitcher and the manager of both teams that another such  pitch will result in the immediate expulsion of that pitcher (or a  replacement) and the manager. If, in the umpire's judgment,  circumstances warrant, both teams may be officially &quot;warned&quot; prior to  the game or at any time during the game. (League Presidents may take  additional action under authority provided in Rule 9.05) To pitch at a  batter's head is unsportsmanlike and highly dangerous. It should be and  is_condemned by everybody. Umpires should act without hesitation in  enforcement of this rule.
                      <br />
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>8.03</strong><br />
                          When a pitcher takes his position at the beginning of each inning, or  when he relieves another pitcher, he shall be permitted to pitch not to  exceed eight preparatory pitches to his catcher during which play shall  be suspended. A league by its own action may limit the number of  preparatory pitches to less than eight preparatory pitches. Such  preparatory pitches shall not consume more than one minute of time. If  a sudden emergency causes a pitcher to be summoned into the game  without any opportunity to warm up, the umpire in chief shall allow him  as many pitches as the umpire deems necessary.
                      <br /><br /><strong>8.04</strong><br />
                        When the bases are unoccupied, the pitcher shall deliver the ball to  the batter within 20 seconds after he receives the ball. Each time the  pitcher delays the game by violating this rule, the umpire shall call  &quot;Ball.&quot; The intent of this rule is to avoid unnecessary delays. The  umpire shall insist that the catcher return the ball promptly to the  pitcher, and that the pitcher take his position on the rubber promptly.  Obvious delay by the pitcher should instantly be penalized by the  umpire.
                      <br /><br /><strong>8.05</strong><br />
                        If  there is a runner, or runners, it is a balk when_ (a) The pitcher,  while touching his plate, makes any motion naturally associated with  his pitch and fails to make such delivery; If a left-handed or  right-handed pitcher swings his free foot past the back edge of the  pitcher's rubber, he is required to pitch to the batter except to throw  to second base on a pick off play. (b) The pitcher, while touching his  plate, feints a throw to first base and fails to complete the throw;  (c) The pitcher, while touching his plate, fails to step directly  toward a base before throwing to that base; Requires the pitcher, while  touching his plate, to step directly toward a base before throwing to  that base. If a pitcher turns or spins off of his free foot without  actually stepping or if he turns his body and throws before stepping,  it is a balk. A pitcher is to step directly toward a base before  throwing to that base but does not require him to throw (except to  first base only) because he steps. It is possible, with runners on  first and third, for the pitcher to step toward third and not throw,  merely to bluff the runner back to third; then seeing the runner on  first start for second, turn and step toward and throw to first base.  This is legal. However, if, with runners on first and third, the  pitcher, while in contact with the rubber, steps toward third and then  immediately and in practically the same motion &quot;wheels&quot; and throws to  first base, it is obviously an attempt to deceive the runner at first  base, and in such a move it is practically impossible to step directly  toward first base before the throw to first base, and such a move shall  be called a balk. Of course, if the pitcher steps off the rubber and  then makes such a move, it is not a balk. (d) The pitcher, while  touching his plate, throws, or feints a throw to an unoccupied base,  except for the purpose of making a play; (e) The pitcher makes an  illegal pitch; A quick pitch is an illegal pitch. Umpires will judge a  quick pitch as one delivered before the batter is reasonably set in the  batter's box. With runners on base the penalty is a balk; with no  runners on base, it is a ball. The quick pitch is dangerous and should  not be permitted. (f) The pitcher delivers the ball to the batter while  he is not facing the batter; (g) The pitcher makes any motion naturally  associated with his pitch while he is not touching the pitcher's plate;  (h) The pitcher unnecessarily delays the game; (i) The pitcher, without  having the ball, stands on or astride the pitcher's plate or while off  the plate, he feints a pitch; (j) The pitcher, after coming to a legal  pitching position, removes one hand from the ball other than in an  actual pitch, or in throwing to a base; (k) The pitcher, while touching  his plate, accidentally or intentionally drops the ball; (l) The  pitcher, while giving an intentional base on balls, pitches when the  catcher is not in the catcher's box; (m)The pitcher delivers the pitch  from Set Position without coming to a stop. PENALTY: The ball is dead,  and each runner shall advance one base without liability to be put out,  unless the batter reaches first on a hit, an error, a base on balls, a  hit batter, or otherwise, and all other runners advance at least one  base, in which case the play proceeds without reference to the balk.  APPROVED RULING: In cases where a pitcher balks and throws wild, either  to a base or to home plate, a runner or runners may advance beyond the  base to which he is entitled at his own risk. APPROVED RULING: A runner  who misses the first base to which he is advancing and who is called  out on appeal shall be considered as having advanced one base for the  purpose of this rule. Umpires should bear in mind that the purpose of  the balk rule is to prevent the pitcher from deliberately deceiving the  base runner. If there is doubt in the umpire's mind, the &quot;intent&quot; of  the pitcher should govern. However, certain specifics should be borne  in mind: (a) Straddling the pitcher's rubber without the ball is to be  interpreted as intent to deceive and ruled a balk. (b) With a runner on  first base the pitcher may make a complete turn, without hesitating  toward first, and throw to second. This is not to be interpreted as  throwing to an unoccupied base.<br />
                      
                      <br /><strong>8.06</strong><br />
                        A professional league shall adopt the following rule pertaining to the  visit of the manager or coach to the pitcher: (a) This rule limits the  number of trips a manager or coach may make to any one pitcher in any  one inning; (b) A second trip to the same pitcher in the same inning  will cause this pitcher's automatic removal; (c) The manager or coach  is prohibited from making a second visit to the mound while the same  batter is at bat, but (d) if a pinch hitter is substituted for this  batter, the manager or coach may make a second visit to the mound, but  must remove the pitcher. A manager or coach is considered to have  concluded his visit to the mound when he leaves the 18 foot circle  surrounding the pitcher's rubber. If the manager or coach goes to the  catcher or infielder and that player then goes to the mound or the  pitcher comes to him at his position before there is an intervening  play (a pitch or other play) that will be the same as the manager or  coach going to the mound. Any attempt to evade or circumvent this rule  by the manager or coach going to the catcher or an infielder and then  that player going to the mound to confer with the pitcher shall  constitute a trip to the mound. If the coach goes to the mound and  removes a pitcher and then the manager goes to the mound to talk with  the new pitcher, that will constitute one trip to that new pitcher that  inning. In a case where a manager has made his first trip to the mound  and then returns the second time to the mound in the same inning with  the same pitcher in the game and the same batter at bat, after being  warned by the umpire that he cannot return to the mound, the manager  shall be removed from the game and the pitcher required to pitch to the  batter until he is retired or gets on base. After the batter is  retired, or becomes a base runner, then this pitcher must be removed  from the game. The manager should be notified that his pitcher will be  removed from the game after he pitches to one hitter, so he can have a  substitute pitcher warmed up. The substitute pitcher will be allowed  eight preparatory pitches or more if in the umpire's judgment  circumstances justify.
