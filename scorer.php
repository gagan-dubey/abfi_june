                      (a) The league president shall appoint an official scorer for each  league championship game. The official scorer shall observe the game  from a position in the press box. The scorer shall have sole authority  to make all decisions involving judgment, such as whether a batter's  advance to first base is the result of a hit or an error. He shall  communicate such decisions to the press box and broadcasting booths by  hand signals or over the press box loud speaker system, and shall  advise the public address announcer of such decisions if requested. The  Official Scorer must make all decisions concerning judgment calls  within twenty four (24) hours after a game has been officially  concluded. No judgment decision shall be changed thereafter except,  upon immediate application to the League President, the scorer may  request a change, citing the reasons for such. In all cases, the  official scorer is not permitted to make a scoring decision which is in  conflict with the scoring rules. After each game, including forfeited  and called games, the scorer shall prepare a report, on a form  prescribed by the league president, listing the date of the game, where  it was played, the names of the competing clubs and the umpires, the  full score of the game, and all records of individual players compiled  according to the system specified in these Official Scoring Rules. He  shall forward this report to the league office within thirty six hours  after the game ends. He shall forward the report of any suspended game  within thirty six hours after the game has been completed, or after it  becomes an official game because it cannot be completed, as provided by  the Official Playing Rules.</br></br>
					  (b) (1) To achieve uniformity in keeping the records of championship  games, the scorer shall conform strictly to the Official Scoring Rules.  The scorer shall have authority to rule on any point not specifically  covered in these rules. <br />
                          (2) If the teams change sides before  three men are put out, the scorer shall immediately inform the umpire  of the mistake.<br />
                          (3) If the game is protested or suspended, the scorer shall make a note  of the exact situation at the time of the protest or suspension,  including the score, the number of outs, the position of any runners,  and the ball and strike count on the batter. NOTE: It is important that  a suspended game resume with exactly the same situation as existed at  the time of suspension. If a protested game is ordered replayed from  the point of protest, it must be resumed with exactly the situation  that existed just before the protested play.<br />
                          (4) The scorer shall not make any decision conflicting with the  Official Playing Rules, or with an umpire's decision. <br />
                          (5) The scorer shall not call the attention of the umpire or of any  member of either team to the fact that a player is batting out of turn.  (c) (1) The scorer is an official representative of the league, and is  entitled to the respect and dignity of his office, and shall be  accorded full protection by the league president. The scorer shall  report to the president any indignity expressed by any manager, player,  club employee or club officer in the course of, or as the result of,  the discharge of his duties. <br />

                          (a) In compiling the official score report, the official scorer shall  list each player's name and his fielding position or positions in the  order in which the player batted, or would have batted if the game ends  before he gets to bat. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>NOTE: </strong>When  a player does not exchange positions with another fielder but is merely  placed in a different spot for a particular batter, do not list this as  a new position.<br />
                          <strong><br />

                          <br />
                          (c) A box score is in balance (or proved) when the total of the team's  times at bat, bases on balls received, hit batters, sacrifice bunts,  sacrifice flies and batters awarded first base because of interference  or obstruction equals the total of that team's runs, players left on  base and the opposing team's putouts. WHEN PLAYER BATS OUT OF TURN <br />
                          <br />
                          (d) When a player bats out of turn, and is put out, and the proper  batter is called out before the ball is pitched to the next batter,  charge the proper batter with a time at bat and score the putout and  any assists the same as if the correct batting order had been followed.  If an improper batter becomes a runner and the proper batter is called  out for having missed his turn at bat, charge the proper batter with a  time at bat, credit the putout to the catcher, and ignore everything  entering into the improper batter's safe arrival on base. If more than  one batter bats out of turn in succession score all plays just as they  occur, skipping the turn at bat of the player or players who first  missed batting in the proper order. CALLED AND FORFEITED GAMES <br />
                          <br />
                          (e) (1) If a regulation game is called, include the record of all  individual and team actions up to the moment the game ends, as defined  in Rules 4.10 and 4.11. If it is a tie game, do not enter a winning or  losing pitcher. <br />
                          (2) If a regulation game is forfeited, include the record of all  individual and team actions up to the time of forfeit. If the winning  team by forfeit is ahead at the time of forfeit, enter as winning and  losing pitchers the players who would have qualified if the game had  been called at the time of forfeit. If the winning team by forfeit is  behind or if the score is tied at the time of forfeit, do not enter a  winning or losing pitcher. If a game is forfeited before it becomes a  regulation game, include no records. Report only the fact of the  forfeit. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>RUNS BATTED IN </strong><br />
                          <strong>10.04</strong><br />
                          (a) Credit the batter with a run batted in for every run which reaches  home base because of the batter's safe hit, sacrifice bunt, sacrifice  fly, infield out or fielder's choice; or which is forced over the plate  by reason of the batter becoming a runner with the bases full (on a  base on balls, or an award of first base for being touched by a pitched  ball, or for interference or obstruction). <br />
                          (1) Credit a run batted in for the run scored by the batter who hits a  home run. Credit a run batted in for each runner who is on base when  the home run is hit and who scores ahead of the batter who hits the  home run.<br />
                          (2) Credit a run batted in for the run scored when, before two are out,  an error is made on a play on which a runner from third base ordinarily  would score.<br />
                          (b) Do not credit a run batted in when the batter grounds into a force  double play or a reverse force double play.<br />
                          (c) Do not credit a run batted in when a fielder is charged with an  error because he muffs a throw at first base which would have completed  a force double play.<br />
                          (d) Scorer's judgment must determine whether a run batted in shall be  credited for a run which scores when a fielder holds the ball, or  throws to a wrong base. Ordinarily, if the runner keeps going, credit a  run batted in; if the runner stops and takes off again when he notices  the misplay, credit the run as scored on a fielder's choice. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>BASE HITS </strong><br />
                          <strong>10.05</strong><br />
                          A base hit shall be scored in the following cases: <br />
                          (a) When a batter reaches first base (or any succeeding base) safely on  a fair ball which settles on the ground or touches a fence before being  touched by a fielder, or which clears a fence;<br />
                          (b) When a batter reaches first base safely on a fair ball hit with  such force, or so slowly, that any fielder attempting to make a play  with it has no opportunity to do so;<br />
                          <br />
                          NOTE: A hit shall be scored if the fielder attempting to handle the  ball cannot make a play, even if such fielder deflects the ball from or  cuts off another fielder who could have put out a runner. <br />
                          <br />
                          (c) When a batter reaches first base safely on a fair ball which takes  an unnatural bounce so that a fielder cannot handle it with ordinary  effort, or which touches the pitcher's plate or any base, (including  home plate), before being touched by a fielder and bounces so that a  fielder cannot handle it with ordinary effort;<br />
                          (d) When a batter reaches first base safely on a fair ball which has  not been touched by a fielder and which is in fair territory when it  reaches the outfield unless in the scorer's judgment it could have been  handled with ordinary effort; <br />
                          (e) When a fair ball which has not been touched by a fielder touches a runner or an umpire. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>EXCEPTION:</strong> Do not score a hit when a runner is called out for having been touched by an Infield Fly; <br />
                          <br />
                          (f) When a fielder unsuccessfully attempts to put out a preceding  runner, and in the scorer's judgment the batter runner would not have  been put out at first base by ordinary effort. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>NOTE</strong>:  In applying the above rules, always give the batter the benefit of the  doubt. A safe course to follow is to score a hit when exceptionally  good fielding of a ball fails to result in a putout. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>10.06 </strong><br />
                          A base hit shall not be scored in the following cases:<br />
                          (a) When a runner is forced out by a batted ball, or would have been forced out except for a fielding error;<br />
                          (b) When the batter apparently hits safely and a runner who is forced  to advance by reason of the batter becoming a runner fails to touch the  first base to which he is advancing and is called out on appeal. Charge  the batter with a time at bat but no hit; <br />
                          (c) When the pitcher, the catcher or any infielder handles a batted  ball and puts out a preceding runner who is attempting to advance one  base or to return to his original base, or would have put out such  runner with ordinary effort except for a fielding error. Charge the  batter with a time at bat but no hit; <br />
                          (d) When a fielder fails in an attempt to put out a preceding runner,  and in the scorer's judgment the batter runner could have been put out  at first base. <br />
                          NOTE: This shall not apply if the fielder merely looks toward or feints  toward another base before attempting to make the putout at first base;<br />
                          (e) When a runner is called out for interference with a fielder  attempting to field a batted ball, unless in the scorer's judgment the  batter runner would have been safe had the interference not occurred. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>DETERMINING VALUE OF BASE HITS</strong><br />
                          <strong>10.07</strong><br />
                          Whether a safe hit shall be scored as one base hit, two base hit, three  base hit or home run when no error or putout results shall be  determined as follows:<br />
                          (a) Subject to the provisions of 10.07 (b) and (c), it is a one base  hit if the batter stops at first base; it is a two base hit if the  batter stops at second base; it a three base hit if the batter stops at  third base; it is a home run if the batter touches all bases and  scores. <br />
                          (b) When, with one or more runners on base, the batter advances more  than one base on a safe hit and the defensive team makes an attempt to  put out a preceding runner, the scorer shall determine whether the  batter made a legitimate two base hit or three base hit, or whether he  advanced beyond first base on the fielder's choice. <br />
                          <br />
                          NOTE: Do not credit the batter with a three base hit when a preceding  runner is put out at the plate, or would have been out but for an  error. Do not credit the batter with a two base hit when a preceding  runner trying to advance from first base is put out at third base, or  would have been out but for an error. However, with the exception of  the above, do not determine the value of base hits by the number of  bases advanced by a preceding runner. A batter may deserve a two base  hit even though a preceding runner advances one or no bases; he may  deserve only a one base hit even though he reaches second base and a  preceding runner advances two bases. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>EXAMPLES: </strong><br />
                          (1) Runner on first, batter hits to right fielder, who throws to third  base in unsuccessful attempt to put out runner. Batter takes second  base. Credit batter with one base hit.<br />
                          (2) Runner on second. Batter hits fair fly ball. Runner holds up to  determine if ball is caught, and advances only to third base, while  batter takes second. Credit batter with two base hit. <br />
                          (3) Runner on third. Batter hits high fair fly. Runner takes lead, then  runs back to tag up, thinking ball will be caught. Ball falls safe, but  runner cannot score, although batter has reached second. Credit batter  with two base hit. <br />
                          <br />
                          (c) When the batter attempts to make a two base hit or a three base hit  by sliding, he must hold the last base to which he advances. If he  overslides and is tagged out before getting back to the base safely, he  shall be credited with only as many bases as he attained safely. If he  overslides second base and is tagged out, he shall be credited with a  one base hit; if he overslides third base and is tagged out, he shall  be credited with a two base hit. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>NOTE:</strong> If the batter overruns second or third base and is tagged out trying to  return, he shall be credited with the last base he touched. If he runs  past second base after reaching that base on his feet, attempts to  return and is tagged out, he shall be credited with a two base hit. If  he runs past third base after reaching that base on his feet, attempts  to return and is tagged out, he shall be credited with a three base  hit. <br />
                          <br />
                          (d) When the batter, after making a  safe hit, is called out for having failed to touch a base, the last  base he reached safely shall determine if he shall be credited with a  one base hit, a two base hit or a three base hit. If he is called out  after missing home base, he shall be credited with a three base hit. If  he is called out for missing third base, he shall be credited with a  two base hit. If he is called out for missing second base, he shall be  credited with a one base hit. If he is called out for missing first  base, he shall be charged with a time at bat, but no hit.<br />
                          <br />
                          (e) When the batter runner is awarded two bases, three bases or a home  run under the provisions of Playing Rules 7.05 or 7.06 (a), he shall be  credited with a two base hit, a three base hit or a home run, as the  case may be. GAME ENDING HITS <br />
                          (f) Subject to the provisions  of 10.07 (g), when the batter ends a game with a safe hit which drives  in as many runs as are necessary to put his team in the lead, he shall  be credited with only as many bases on his hit as are advanced by the  runner who scores the winning run, and then only if the batter runs out  his hit for as many bases as are advanced by the runner who scores the  winning run. NOTE: Apply this rule even when the batter is  theoretically entitled to more bases because of being awarded an  &quot;automatic&quot; extra base hit under various provisions of Playing Rules  6.09 and 7.05. <br />
                          (g) When the batter ends a game with a home run hit out of the playing  field, he and any runners on base are entitled to score. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>STOLEN BASES </strong><br />
                          <strong>10.08</strong><br />
                          A stolen base shall be credited to a runner whenever he advances one  base unaided by a hit, a putout, an error, a force out, a fielder's  choice, a passed ball, a wild pitch or a balk, subject to the following:<br />
                          <br />
                          (a) When a runner starts for the next base before the pitcher delivers  the ball and the pitch results in what ordinarily is scored a wild  pitch or passed ball, credit the runner with a stolen base and do not  charge the misplay. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>EXCEPTION:</strong> If, as a result of the misplay, the stealing runner advances an extra  base, or another runner also advances, score the wild pitch or passed  ball as well as the stolen base. <br />
                          <br />
                          (b) When  a runner is attempting to steal, and the catcher, after receiving the  pitch, makes a wild throw trying to prevent the stolen base, credit a  stolen base. Do not charge an error unless the wild throw permits the  stealing runner to advance one or more extra bases, or permits another  runner to advance, in which case credit the stolen base and charge one  error to the catcher. <br />
                          (c) When a runner, attempting to steal, or after being picked off base,  evades being put out in a run down play and advances to the next base  without the aid of an error, credit the runner with a stolen base. If  another runner also advances on the play, credit both runners with  stolen bases. If a runner advances while another runner, attempting to  steal, evades being put out in a run down play and returns safely,  without the aid of an error, to the base he originally occupied, credit  a stolen base to the runner who advances.<br />
                          (d) When a double or triple steal is attempted and one runner is thrown  out before reaching and holding the base he is attempting to steal, no  other runner shall be credited with a stolen base.<br />
                          (e) When a runner is tagged out after oversliding a base, while  attempting either to return to that base or to advance to the next  base, he shall not be credited with a stolen base. <br />
                          (f) When in the scorer's judgment a runner attempting to steal is safe  because of a muffed throw, do not credit a stolen base. Credit an  assist to the fielder who made the throw; charge an error to the  fielder who muffed the throw, and charge the runner with &quot;caught  stealing.&quot; <br />
                          (g) No stolen base shall be scored when a runner advances solely  because of the defensive team's indifference to his advance. Score as a  fielder's choice. CAUGHT STEALING<br />
                          <br />
                          (h) A  runner shall be charged as &quot;Caught Stealing&quot; if he is put out, or would  have been put out by errorless play when he<br />
                          (1) Tries to steal.<br />
                          (2) Is picked off a base and tries to advance (any move toward the next  base shall be considered an attempt to advance).<br />
                          (3) Overslides while stealing. NOTE: In those instances where a pitched  ball eludes the catcher and the runner is put out trying to advance, no  caught stealing shall be charged. No caught stealing should be charged  when a runner is awarded a base due to obstruction. SACRIFICES <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>10.09</strong><br />
                          (a) Score a sacrifice bunt when, before two are out, the batter  advances one or more runners with a bunt and is put out at first base,  or would have been put out except for a fielding error.<br />
                          (b) Score a sacrifice bunt when, before two are out, the fielders  handle a bunted ball without error in an unsuccessful attempt to put  out a preceding runner advancing one base. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong> EXCEPTION:</strong> When an attempt to turn a bunt into a putout of a preceding runner  fails, and in the scorer's judgment perfect play would not have put out  the batter at first base, the batter shall be credited with a one base  hit and not a sacrifice. <br />
                          <br />
                          (c) Do not score  a sacrifice bunt when any runner is put out attempting to advance one  base on a bunt. Charge the batter with a time at bat.<br />
                          (d) Do not score a sacrifice bunt when, in the judgment of the scorer,  the batter is bunting primarily for a base hit and not for the purpose  of advancing a runner or runners. Charge the batter with a time at bat. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong> NOTE:</strong> In applying the above rule, always give the batter the benefit of the doubt.<br />
                          <br />
                          (e) Score a sacrifice fly when, before two are out, the batter hits a  fly ball or a line drive handled by an outfielder or an infielder  running in the outfield which <br />
                          (1) is caught, and a runner scores after the catch, or <br />
                          (2) is dropped, and a runner scores, if in the scorer's judgment the  runner could have scored after the catch had the fly been caught.<br />
                          <strong>NOTE:</strong> Score a sacrifice fly in accordance with 10.09 (e) (2) even though  another runner is forced out by reason of the batter becoming a runner. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>PUTOUTS</strong><br />
                          <strong>10.10 </strong><br />
                          A putout shall be credited to each fielder who <br />
                          (1) catches a fly ball or a line drive, whether fair or foul; <br />
                          (2) catches a thrown ball which puts out a batter or runner, or <br />
                          (3) tags a runner when the runner is off the base to which he legally is entitled. <br />
                          <br />
                          (a) Automatic putouts shall be credited to the catcher as follows: <br />
                          (1) When the batter is called out for an illegally batted ball;<br />
                          (2) When the batter is called out for bunting foul for his third strike; (Note exception in 10.17 (a) (4)). <br />
                          (3) When the batter is called out for being touched by his own batted ball;<br />
                          (4) When the batter is called out for interfering with the catcher. <br />
                          (5) When the batter is called out for failing to bat in his proper turn; (See 10.03 (d)). <br />
                          (6) When the batter is called out for refusing to touch first base after receiving a base on balls; <br />
                          (7) When a runner is called out for refusing to advance from third base to home with the winning run.<br />
                          <br />
                          (b) Other automatic putouts shall be credited as follows (Credit no  assists on these plays except as specified): <br />
                          (1) When the batter is called out on an Infield Fly which is not  caught, credit the putout to the fielder who the scorer believes could  have made the catch; <br />
                          (2) When a runner is called out for being touched by a fair ball  (including an Infield Fly), credit the putout to the fielder nearest  the ball; <br />
                          (3) When a runner is called out for running out of line to avoid being  tagged, credit the putout to the fielder whom the runner avoided; <br />
                          (4) When a runner is called out for passing another runner, credit the  putout to the fielder nearest the point of passing; <br />
                          (5) When a runner is called out for running the bases in reverse order,  credit the putout to the fielder covering the base he left in starting  his reverse run; <br />
                          (6) When a runner is called out for having interfered with a fielder,  credit the putout to the fielder with whom the runner interfered,  unless the fielder was in the act of throwing the ball when the  interference occurred, in which case credit the putout to the fielder  for whom the throw was intended, and credit an assist to the fielder  whose throw was interfered with; <br />
                          (7) When the batter runner is called out because of interference by a  preceding runner, as provided in Playing Rule 6.05 (m), credit the  putout to the first baseman. If the fielder interfered with was in the  act of throwing the ball, credit him with an assist, but credit only  one assist on any one play under the provisions of 10.10 (b) (6) and  (7). <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>ASSISTS</strong><br />
                          <strong>10.11 </strong><br />
                          An assist shall be credited to each fielder who throws or deflects a  batted or thrown ball in such a way that a putout results, or would  have resulted except for a subsequent error by any fielder. Only one  assist and no more shall be credited to each fielder who throws or  deflects the ball in a run down play which results in a putout, or  would have resulted in a putout, except for a subsequent error. <br />
                          <strong> NOTE:</strong> Mere ineffective contact with the ball shall not be considered an  assist. &quot;Deflect&quot; shall mean to slow down or change the direction of  the ball and thereby effectively assist in putting out a batter or  runner.<br />
                          <br />
                          (a) Credit an assist to each  fielder who throws or deflects the ball during a play which results in  a runner being called out for interference, or for running out of line. <br />
                          (b) Do not credit an assist to the pitcher on a strikeout. <br />
                          <strong> <br />
                            EXCEPTION:</strong> Credit an assist if the pitcher fields an uncaught third strike and makes a throw which results in a putout. <br />
                          <br />
                          (c) Do not credit an assist to the pitcher when, as the result of a  legal pitch received by the catcher, a runner is put out, as when the  catcher picks a runner off base, throws out a runner trying to steal,  or tags a runner trying to score. <br />
                          (d) Do not credit an assist to a fielder whose wild throw permits a  runner to advance, even though the runner subsequently is put out as a  result of continuous play. A play which follows a misplay (whether or  not it is an error) is a new play, and the fielder making any misplay  shall not be credited with an assist unless he takes part in the new  play. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>DOUBLE PLAYS_TRIPLE PLAYS </strong><br />
                          <strong>10.12</strong><br />
                          Credit participation in the double play or triple play to each fielder  who earns a putout or an assist when two or three players are put out  between the time a pitch is delivered and the time the ball next  becomes dead or is next in possession of the pitcher in pitching  position, unless an error or misplay intervenes between putouts.<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>NOTE: </strong>Credit  the double play or triple play also if an appeal play after the ball is  in possession of the pitcher results in an additional putout. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>ERRORS</strong><br />
                          <strong> 10.13<br />
                          </strong> An error shall be charged for each misplay (fumble, muff or wild throw)  which prolongs the time at bat of a batter or which prolongs the life  of a runner, or which permits a runner to advance one or more bases.<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>NOTE (1)</strong> Slow handling of the ball which does not involve mechanical misplay shall not be construed as an error. <br />
                          <strong> NOTE (2)</strong> It is not necessary that the fielder touch the ball to be charged with  an error. If a ground ball goes through a fielder's legs or a pop fly  falls untouched and in the scorer's judgment the fielder could have  handled the ball with ordinary effort, an error shall be charged.<br />
                          <strong> <br />
                            NOTE (3)</strong> Mental mistakes or misjudgments are not to be scored as errors unless specifically covered in the rules. <br />
                          <br />
                          (a) An error shall be charged against any fielder when he muffs a foul  fly, to prolong the time at bat of a batter whether the batter  subsequently reaches first base or is put out. <br />
                          (b) An error shall be charged against any fielder when he catches a  thrown ball or a ground ball in time to put out the batter runner and  fails to tag first base or the batter runner. <br />
                          (c) An error shall be charged against any fielder when he catches a  thrown ball or a ground ball in time to put out any runner on a force  play and fails to tag the base or the runner. <br />
                          (d) (1) An error shall be charged against any fielder whose wild throw  permits a runner to reach a base safely, when in the scorer's judgment  a good throw would have put out the runner. EXCEPTION: No error shall  be charged under this section if the wild throw is made attempting to  prevent a stolen base. <br />
                          (2) An error shall be charged against any fielder whose wild throw in  attempting to prevent a runner's advance permits that runner or any  other runner to advance one or more bases beyond the base he would have  reached had the throw not been wild. <br />
                          (3) An error shall be charged against any fielder whose throw takes an  unnatural bounce, or touches a base or the pitcher's plate, or touches  a runner, a fielder or an umpire, thereby permitting any runner to  advance.<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong> NOTE: </strong>Apply  this rule even when it appears to be an injustice to a fielder whose  throw was accurate. Every base advanced by a runner must be accounted  for.<br />
                          <br />
                          (4) Charge only one error on any wild  throw, regardless of the number of bases advanced by one or more  runners. <br />
                          (e) An error shall be charged against any fielder whose failure to  stop, or try to stop, an accurately thrown ball permits a runner to  advance, providing there was occasion for the throw. If such throw be  made to second base, the scorer shall determine whether it was the duty  of the second baseman or the shortstop to stop the ball, and an error  shall be charged to the negligent player.<br />
                          <strong> <br />
                            NOTE:</strong> If in the scorer's judgment there was no occasion for the throw, an error shall be charged to the fielder who threw the ball.<br />
                          (f) When an umpire awards the batter or any runner or runners one or  more bases because of interference or obstruction, charge the fielder  who committed the interference or obstruction with one error, no matter  how many bases the batter, or runner or runners, may be advanced. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>NOTE:</strong> Do not charge an error if obstruction does not change the play in the opinion of the scorer.<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>10.14</strong><br />
                          No error shall be charged in the following cases:<br />
                          (a) No error shall be charged against the catcher when after receiving  the pitch, he makes a wild throw attempting to prevent a stolen base,  unless the wild throw permits the stealing runner to advance one or  more extra bases, or permits any other runner to advance one or more  bases.<br />
                          (b) No error shall be charged against any fielder who makes a wild  throw if in the scorer's judgment the runner would not have been put  out with ordinary effort by a good throw, unless such wild throw  permits any runner to advance beyond the base he would have reached had  the throw not been wild. <br />
                          (c) No error shall be charged against any fielder when he makes a wild  throw in attempting to complete a double play or triple play, unless  such wild throw enables any runner to advance beyond the base he would  have reached had the throw not been wild. <br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>NOTE:</strong> When a fielder muffs a thrown ball which, if held, would have completed  a double play or triple play, charge an error to the fielder who drops  the ball and credit an assist to the fielder who made the throw. <br />
                          <br />
                          (d) No error shall be charged against any fielder when, after fumbling  a ground ball or dropping a fly ball, a line drive or a thrown ball, he  recovers the ball in time to force out a runner at any base. <br />
                          (e) No error shall be charged against any fielder who permits a foul  fly to fall safe with a runner on third base before two are out, if in  the scorer's judgment the fielder deliberately refuses the catch in  order that the runner on third shall not score after the catch.<br />
                          (f) Because the pitcher and catcher handle the ball much more than  other fielders, certain misplays on pitched balls are defined in Rule  10.15 as wild pitches and passed balls. No error shall be charged when  a wild pitch or passed ball is scored.<br />
                          <br />
                          (1) No error shall be charged when the batter is awarded first base on  four called balls or because he was touched by a pitched ball, or when  he reaches first base as the result of a wild pitch or passed ball.<br />
                          (i) When the third strike is a wild pitch, permitting the batter to  reach first base, score a strikeout and a wild pitch.<br />
                          (ii) When the third strike is a passed ball, permitting the batter to  reach first base, score a strikeout and a passed ball.<br />
                          <br />
                          (2) No error shall be charged when a runner or runners advance as the  result of a passed ball, a wild pitch or a balk. <br />
                          <br />
                          (i) When the fourth called ball is a wild pitch or a passed ball, and as a result<br />
                          (a) the batter runner advances to a base beyond first base; <br />
                          (b) any runner forced to advance by the base on balls advances more than one base, or<br />
                          (c) any runner, not forced to advance, advances one or more bases,  score the base on balls, and also the wild pitch or passed ball, as the  case may be; <br />
                          <br />
                          (ii) When the catcher recovers the ball after a wild pitch or passed  ball on the third strike, and throws out the batter runner at first  base, or tags out the batter runner, but another runner or runners  advance, score the strikeout, the putout and assists, if any, and  credit the advance of the other runner or runners as having been made  on the play.<br />

                          (a) A wild pitch shall be charged when a legally delivered ball is so  high, or so wide, or so low that the catcher does not stop and control  the ball by ordinary effort, thereby permitting a runner or runners to  advance. <br />
                          (1) A wild pitch shall be charged when a legally delivered ball touches  the ground before reaching home plate and is not handled by the  catcher, permitting a runner or runners to advance.<br />
                          <br />
                          (b) A catcher shall be charged with a passed ball when he fails to hold  or to control a legally pitched ball which should have been held or  controlled with ordinary effort, thereby permitting a runner or runners  to advance.<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>BASES ON BALLS<br />
                            10.16</strong><br />
                          <br />
                          (a) A base on balls shall be scored whenever a batter is awarded first  base because of four balls having been pitched outside the strike zone,  but when the fourth such ball touches the batter it shall be scored as  a &quot;hit batter.&quot; (See 10.18 (h) for procedure when more than one pitcher  is involved in giving a base on balls: Also see 10.17 (b) relative to  substitute batter who receives base on balls.)
                    (b)  Intentional base on balls shall be scored when the pitcher makes no  attempt to throw the last pitch to the batter into the strike zone but  purposely throws the ball wide to the catcher outside the catcher's  box. <br />
                        (1) If a batter awarded a base on balls is called out for  refusing to advance to first base, do not credit the base on balls.  Charge a time at bat.<br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>STRIKEOUTS<br />
                          10.17 </strong><br />
                        (a) A strikeout shall be scored whenever: <br />
                        (1) A batter is put out by a third strike caught by the catcher;<br />
                        (2) A batter is put out by a third strike not caught when there is a runner on first before two are out; <br />
                        (3) A batter becomes a runner because a third strike is not caught; <br />
                        (4) A batter bunts foul on third strike.<br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>EXCEPTION</strong>:  If such bunt on third strike results in a foul fly caught by any  fielder, do not score a strikeout. Credit the fielder who catches such  foul fly with a putout. 
                     (b)  When the batter leaves the game with two strikes against him, and the  substitute batter completes a strikeout, charge the strikeout and the  time at bat to the first batter. If the substitute batter completes the  turn at bat in any other manner, including a base on balls, score the  action as having been that of the substitute batter.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>EARNED RUNS <br />
                              10.18</strong><br />
                        An earned run is a run for which the pitcher is held accountable. In  determining earned runs, the inning should be reconstructed without the  errors (which include catcher's interference) and passed balls, and the  benefit of the doubt should always be given to the pitcher in  determining which bases would have been reached by errorless play. For  the purpose of determining earned runs, an intentional base on balls,  regardless of the circumstances, shall be construed in exactly the same  manner as any other base on balls.<br />
                        <br />
                        (a) An earned run shall be charged every time a runner reaches home  base by the aid of safe hits, sacrifice bunts, a sacrifice fly, stolen  bases, putouts, fielder's choices, bases on balls, hit batters, balks  or wild pitches (including a wild pitch on third strike which permits a  batter to reach first base) before fielding chances have been offered  to put out the offensive team. For the purpose of this rule, a  defensive interference penalty shall be construed as a fielding chance. <br />
                        (1) A wild pitch is solely the pitcher's fault, and contributes to an  earned run just as a base on balls or a balk.<br />
                        <br />
                        (b) No run shall be earned when scored by a runner who reaches first base <br />
                        (1) on a hit or otherwise after his time at bat is prolonged by a muffed foul fly; <br />
                        (2) because of interference or obstruction or<br />
                        (3) because of any fielding error.<br />
                        <br />
                        (c) No run shall be earned when scored by a runner whose life is  prolonged by an error, if such runner would have been put out by  errorless play. <br />
                        (d) No run shall be earned when the runner's advance is aided by an  error, a passed ball, or defensive interference or obstruction, if the  scorer judges that the run would not have scored without the aid of  such misplay. <br />
                        (e) An error by a pitcher is treated exactly the same as an error by  any other fielder in computing earned runs.<br />
                        (f) Whenever a fielding error occurs, the pitcher shall be given the  benefit of the doubt in determining to which bases any runners would  have advanced had the fielding of the defensive team been errorless.<br />
                        (g) When pitchers are changed during an inning, the relief pitcher  shall not be charged with any run (earned or unearned) scored by a  runner who was on base at the time he entered the game, nor for runs  scored by any runner who reaches base on a fielder's choice which puts  out a runner left on base by the preceding pitcher. <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong> NOTE:</strong> It is the intent of this rule to charge each pitcher with the number of  runners he put on base, rather than with the individual runners. When a  pitcher puts runners on base, and is relieved, he shall be charged with  all runs subsequently scored up to and including the number of runners  he left on base when he left the game, unless such runners are put out  without action by the batter, i.e., caught stealing, picked off base,  or called out for interference when a batter runner does not reach  first base on the play.<br />
                        <br />
                        <strong> EXCEPTION:</strong> see example 7. EXAMPLES: <br />
                        (1) P1 walks A and is relieved by P2. B grounds out, sending A to  second. C flies out. D singles, scoring A. Charge run to P1.<br />
                        (2) P1 walks A and is relieved by P2. B forces A at second. C grounds  out, sending B to second. D singles, scoring B. Charge run to P1.<br />
                        (3) P1 walks A and is relieved by P2. B singles, sending A to third. C  grounds to short, and A is out at home, B going to second. D flies out.  E singles, scoring B. Charge run to P1.<br />
                        (4) P1 walks A and is relieved by P2. B walks. C flies out. A is picked  off second. D doubles, scoring B from first. Charge run to P2.<br />
                        (5) P1 walks A and is relieved by P2. P2 walks B and is relieved by P3.  C forces A at third. D forces B at third. E hits home run, scoring  three runs. Charge one run to P1; one run to P2, one run to P3. <br />
                        (6) P1 walks A, and is relieved by P2, P2 walks B. C singles, filling  the bases. D forces A at home. E singles, scoring B and C. Charge one  run to P1 and one run to P2.<br />
                        (7) P1 walks A, and is relieved by P2. P2 allows B to single, but A is  out trying for third. B takes second on the throw. C singles, scoring  B. Charge run to P2.<br />
                        <br />
                        (h) A relief pitcher shall not be held accountable when the first  batter to whom he pitches reaches first base on four called balls if  such batter has a decided advantage in the ball and strike count when  pitchers are changed. <br />
                        (1) If, when pitchers are changed, the count is 2 balls, no strike, 2  balls, 1 strike, 3 balls, no strike, 3 balls, 1 strike, 3 balls, 2  strikes, and the batter gets a base on balls, charge that batter and  the base on balls to the preceding pitcher, not to the relief pitcher.<br />
                        (2) Any other action by such batter, such as reaching base on a hit, an  error, a fielder's choice, a force out, or being touched by a pitched  ball, shall cause such a batter to be charged to the relief pitcher. <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong> NOTE: </strong>The provisions of 10.18 (h) (2) shall not be construed as affecting or conflicting with the provisions of 10.18 (g).<br />
                        <br />
                        (3) If, when pitchers are changed, the count is 2 balls, 2 strikes, 1  ball, 2 strikes, 1 ball, 1 strike, 1 ball, no strike, no ball, 2  strikes, no ball, 1 strike, charge that batter and his actions to the  relief pitcher. <br />
                        (i) When pitchers are changed during an inning, the relief pitcher  shall not have the benefit of previous chances for outs not accepted in  determining earned runs. <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>NOTE:</strong> It is the intent of this rule to charge relief pitchers with earned  runs for which they are solely responsible. In some instances, runs  charged as earned against the relief pitcher can be charged as unearned  against the team. <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong> EXAMPLES:</strong><br />
                        (1) With two out, P1 walks A. B reaches base on an error. P2 relieves  P1. C hits home run, scoring three runs. Charge two unearned runs to  P1, one earned run to P2.<br />
                        (2) With two out, P1 walks A and B and is relieved by P2. C reaches  base on an error. D hits home run, scoring four runs. Charge two  unearned runs to P1, two unearned runs to P2. <br />
                        (3) With none out, P1 walks A. B reaches base on an error. P2 relieves  P1. C hits home run, scoring three runs. D and E strike out. F reaches  base on an error. G hits home run, scoring two runs. Charge two runs,  one earned, to P1. Charge three runs, one earned, to P2. <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>WINNING AND LOSING PITCHER<br />
                          10.19</strong><br />
                        (a) Credit the starting pitcher with a game won only if he has pitched  at least five complete innings and his team not only is in the lead  when he is replaced but remains in the lead the remainder of the game.<br />
                        (b) The &quot;must pitch five complete innings&quot; rule in respect to the  starting pitcher shall be in effect for all games of six or more  innings. In a five inning game, credit the starting pitcher with a game  won if he has pitched at least four complete innings and his team not  only is in the lead when he is replaced but remains in the lead the  remainder of the game. <br />
                        (c) When the starting pitcher cannot be credited with the victory  because of the provisions of 10.19 (a) or (b) and more than one relief  pitcher is used, the victory shall be awarded on the following basis:<br />
                        <br />
                        (1) When, during the tenure of the starting pitcher, the winning team  assumes the lead and maintains it to the finish of the game, credit the  victory to the relief pitcher judged by the scorer to have been the  most effective; <br />
                        (2) Whenever the score is tied the game becomes a new contest insofar  as the winning and losing pitcher is concerned; <br />
                        (3) Once the opposing team assumes the lead all pitchers who have  pitched up to that point are excluded from being credited with the  victory except that if the pitcher against whose pitching the opposing  team gained the lead continues to pitch until his team regains the  lead, which it holds to the finish of the game, that pitcher shall be  the winning pitcher;<br />
                        (4) The winning relief pitcher shall be the one who is the pitcher of  record when his team assumes the lead and maintains it to the finish of  the game.<br />
                        <br />
                        <strong> EXCEPTION: </strong>Do  not credit a victory to a relief pitcher who is ineffective in a brief  appearance, when a succeeding relief pitcher pitches effectively in  helping his team maintain the lead. In such cases, credit the  succeeding relief pitcher with the victory. <br />
                        <br />
                        (d) When a pitcher is removed for a substitute batter or substitute  runner, all runs scored by his team during the inning in which he is  removed shall be credited to his benefit in determining the pitcher of  record when his team assumes the lead. <br />
                        (e) Regardless of how many innings the first pitcher has pitched, he  shall be charged with the loss of the game if he is replaced when his  team is behind in the score, or falls behind because of runs charged to  him after he is replaced, and his team thereafter fails either to tie  the score or gain the lead.<br />
                        (f) No pitcher shall be credited with pitching a shutout unless he  pitches the complete game, or unless he enters the game with none out  before the opposing team has scored in the first inning, puts out the  side without a run scoring and pitches all the rest of the game. When  two or more pitchers combine to pitch a shutout a notation to that  effect should be included in the league's official pitching records. <br />
                        (g) In some non championship games (such as the Major League All Star  Game) it is provided in advance that each pitcher shall work a stated  number of innings, usually two or three. In such games, it is customary  to credit the victory to the pitcher of record, whether starter or  reliever, when the winning team takes a lead which it maintains to the  end of the game, unless such pitcher is knocked out after the winning  team has a commanding lead, and the scorer believes a subsequent  pitcher is entitled to credit for the victory. <br />

                        <br />
                        (1) He is the finishing pitcher in a game won by his club; and <br />

                        (3) He qualifies under one of the following conditions: <br />
                        <br />
                        (a) He enters the game with a lead of no more than three runs and pitches for at least one inning; or <br />
                        (b) He enters the game, regardless of the count, with the potential  tying run either on base, or at bat, or on deck (that is, the potential  tying run is either already on base or is one of the first two batsmen  he faces); or<br />
                        (c) He pitches effectively for at least three innings. No more than one save may be credited in each game.<br />

                        The league president shall appoint an official statistician. The  statistician shall maintain an accumulative record of all the batting,  fielding, running and pitching records specified in 10.02 for every  player who appears in a league championship game. The statistician  shall prepare a tabulated report at the end of the season, including  all individual and team records for every championship game, and shall  submit this report to the league president. This report shall identify  each player by his first name and surname, and shall indicate as to  each batter whether he bats right-handed, left-handed or both ways; as  to each fielder and pitcher, whether he throws righthanded or  lefthanded. When a player listed in the starting lineup for the  visiting club is substituted for before he plays defensively, he shall  not receive credit in the defensive statistics (fielding), unless he  actually plays that position during a game. All such players, however,  shall be credited with one game played (in &quot;batting statistics&quot;) as  long as they are announced into the game or listed on the official  lineup card. Any games played to break a divisional tie shall be  included in the statistics for that championship season. <br />

                        To compute <br />
                        (a) Percentage of games won and lost, divide the number of games won by the total games won and lost; <br />

                        (c) Slugging percentage, divide the total bases of all safe hits by the  total times at bat, as defined in 10.02 (a); <br />
                        (d) Fielding average, divide the total putouts and assists by the total of putouts, assists and errors; <br />
                        (e) Pitcher's earned run average, multiply the total earned runs  charged against his pitching by 9, and divide the result by the total  number of innings he pitched. <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong> NOTE:</strong> Earned run average shall be calculated on the basis of total innings pitched including fractional innings. <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong> EXAMPLE:</strong> 9 1/3 innings pitched and 3 earned runs is an earned run average of 2.89 (3 ER times 9 divided by 9 1/3 equals 2.89). <br />
                        <br />
                        (f) On base percentage, divide the total of hits, all bases on balls,  and hit by pitch by the total of at bats, all bases on balls, hit by  pitch and sacrifice flies. NOTE: For the purpose of computing on base  percentage, ignore being awarded first base on interference or  obstruction. <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR INDIVIDUAL CHAMPIONSHIPS<br />
                          10.23 </strong><br />
                        <br />
                        To assure uniformity in establishing the batting, pitching and fielding  championships of professional leagues, such champions shall meet the  following minimum performance standards: (a) The individual batting  champion or slugging champion shall be the player with the highest  batting average or slugging percentage, provided he is credited with as  many or more total appearances at the plate in League Championship  games as the number of games scheduled for each club in his league that  season, multiplied by 3.1 in the case of a major league player. <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>EXCEPTION: </strong>However,  if there is any player with fewer than the required number of plate  appearances whose average would be the highest, if he were charged with  the required number of plate appearances or official at bats, then that  player shall be awarded the batting championship or slugging  championship.<br />
                        <br />
                        <strong> EXAMPLE: </strong>If  a major league schedules 162 games for each club, 502 plate appearances  qualify (162 times 3.1 equals 502). If a National Association league  schedules 140 games for each club, 378 plate appearances qualify (140  times 2.7 equals 378). Total appearances at the plate shall include  official times at bat, plus bases on balls, times hit by pitcher,  sacrifice hits, sacrifice flies and times awarded first base because of  interference or obstruction. (b) The individual pitching champion shall  be the pitcher with the lowest earned run average, provided that he has  pitched at least as many innings as the number of games scheduled for  each club in his league that season. <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong> EXCEPTION:</strong> However, pitchers in National Association leagues shall qualify for the  pitching championship by having the lowest earned run average and  having pitched at least as many innings as 80% of the number of games  scheduled for each club in his league that season. <br />
                        (c) The  individual fielding champions shall be the fielders with the highest  fielding average at each position, provided: <br />
                        (1) A catcher must have participated as a catcher in at least one half  the number of games scheduled for each club in his league that season; <br />
                        (2) An infielder or outfielder must have participated at his position  in at least two thirds of the number of games scheduled for each club  in his league that season; <br />
                        (3) A pitcher must have pitched at least as many innings as the number  of games scheduled for each club in his league that season. EXCEPTION:  If another pitcher has a fielding average as high or higher, and has  handled more total chances in a lesser number of innings, he shall be  the fielding champion. <br />
                        <strong>GUIDELINES FOR CUMULATIVE PERFORMANCE RECORDS<br />
                          10.24 </strong><br />
                        <strong>CONSECUTIVE HITTING STREAKS.</strong><br />
                        (a) A consecutive hitting streak shall not be terminated if the plate  appearance results in a base on balls, hit batsman, defensive  interference or a sacrifice bunt. A sacrifice fly shall terminate the  streak.<br />
                        (b) <strong>CONSECUTIVE GAME HITTING STREAKS.</strong> A consecutive game hitting streak shall not be terminated if all the  player's plate appearances (one or more) result in a base on balls, hit  batsman, defensive interference or a sacrifice bunt. The streak shall  terminate if the player has a sacrifice fly and no hit. The player's  individual consecutive game hitting streak shall be determined by the  consecutive games in which the player appears and is not determined by  his club's games. <br />
                        (c)<strong> CONSECUTIVE PLAYING STREAK. </strong>A  consecutive game playing streak shall be extended if the player plays  one half inning on defense, or if he completes a time at bat by  reaching base or being put out. A pinch running appearance only shall  not extend the streak. If a player is ejected from a game by an umpire  before he can comply with the requirements of this rule, his streak  shall continue.<br />
                        (d)<strong> SUSPENDED GAMES. </strong>For  the purpose of this rule, all performances in the completion of a  suspended game shall be considered as occurring on the original date of  the game. <br />
