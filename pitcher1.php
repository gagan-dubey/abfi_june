												As a pitcher, you must be able to throw the ball fast and accurately. You are the most important player on the team. Here are some tips on how to pitch.</br></br> 
												&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Grip the ball on the wide seams.</br>
												&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*  Step toward the batter and push off the mound.</br>
												&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Throw overhead with a downward snap of the wrist.</br>
												&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Follow through with the fingers almost touching the ground.</br>
												&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Keep your eyes on the catcher`s glove at all times.</br>
												&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* After the pitch be ready to field the ball.</br>
												&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Warm up about 15 minutes before pitching a game or before an important practice session.</br>
												&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* For practice in control, try the "simulated strike zone" idea. Drive two poles into the ground, or use two standards            about 8 feet apart. Tie heavy cord to the posts to form a strike zone-a rectangle as wide as home plate and as high            as the distance between the batter`s knees and armpits. Use a catcher and a home plate, and practice pitching into            this zone.</p> </br></br>
