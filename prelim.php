<img class="di" src="images/di1.jpg"><strong>3.01</strong><br />
                            Before the game begins the umpire shall: (a) Require strict observance  of all rules governing implements of play and equipment of players; (b)  Be sure that all playing lines (heavy lines on Diagrams No. 1 and No.  2) are marked with lime, chalk or other white material easily  distinguishable from the ground or grass; (c) Receive from the home  club a supply of regulation baseballs, the number and make to be  certified to the home club by the league president. Each ball shall be  enclosed in a sealed package bearing the signature of the league  president, and the seal shall not be broken until just prior to game  time when the umpire shall open each package to inspect the ball and  remove its gloss. The umpire shall be the sole judge of the fitness of  the balls to be used in the game; (d) Be assured by the home club that  at least one dozen regulation reserve balls are immediately available  for use if required; (e) Have in his possession at least two alternate  balls and shall require replenishment of such supply of alternate balls  as needed throughout the game. Such alternate balls shall be put in  play when_<br />
                            (1) A ball has been batted out of the playing field or into the spectator area;<br />
                            (2) A ball has become discolored or unfit for further use;<br />
                            (3) The pitcher requests such alternate ball. The umpire shall not give  an alternate ball to the pitcher until play has ended and the  previously used ball is dead. After a thrown or batted ball goes out of  the playing field, play shall not be resumed with an alternate ball  until the runners have reached the bases to which they are entitled.  After a home run is hit out of the playing grounds, the umpire shall  not deliver a new ball to the pitcher or the catcher until the batter  hitting the home run has crossed the plate.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong> 3.02</strong><br />
                            No player shall intentionally discolor or damage the ball by rubbing it  with soil, rosin, paraffin, licorice, sand paper, emery paper or other  foreign substance. PENALTY: The umpire shall demand the ball and remove  the offender from the game. In case the umpire cannot locate the  offender, and if the pitcher delivers such discolored or damaged ball  to the batter, the pitcher shall be removed from the game at once and  shall be suspended automatically for ten days.<br />

<img class="di" src="images/di2.jpg"><strong> 3.03</strong><br />
                            A player, or players, may be substituted during a game at any time the  ball is dead. A substitute player shall bat in the replaced player's  position in the team's batting order. A player once removed from a game  shall not re enter that game. If a substitute enters the game in place  of a player manager, the manager may thereafter go to the coaching  lines at his discretion. When two or more substitute players of the  defensive team enter the game at the same time, the manager shall,  immediately before they take their positions as fielders, designate to  the umpire in chief such players' positions in the team's batting order  and the umpire in chief shall so notify the official scorer. If this  information is not immediately given to the umpire in chief, he shall  have authority to designate the substitutes' places in the batting  order. A pitcher may change to another position only once during the  same inning; e.g. the pitcher will not be allowed to assume a position  other than a pitcher more than once in the same inning. Any player  other than a pitcher substituted for an injured player shall be allowed  five warm up throws. (See Rule 8.03 for pitchers.)<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>3.04</strong><br />
                            A player whose name is on his team's batting order may not become a  substitute runner for another member of his team. This rule is intended  to eliminate the practice of using so called courtesy runners. No  player in the game shall be permitted to act as a courtesy runner for a  teammate. No player who has been in the game and has been taken out for  a substitute shall return as a courtesy runner. Any player not in the  lineup, if used as a runner, shall be considered as a substitute  player. <br />

<img class="di" src="images/di3.jpg"> <strong>3.05</strong><br />
                            (a) The pitcher named in the batting order handed the umpire in chief,  as provided in Rules 4.01 (a) and 4.01 (b), shall pitch to the first  batter or any substitute batter until such batter is put out or reaches  first base, unless the pitcher sustains injury or illness which, in the  judgment of the umpire in chief, incapacitates him from pitching. (b)  If the pitcher is replaced, the substitute pitcher shall pitch to the  batter then at bat, or any substitute batter, until such batter is put  out or reaches first base, or until the offensive team is put out,  unless the substitute pitcher sustains injury or illness which, in the  umpire in chief's judgment, incapacitates him for further play as a  pitcher. (c) If an improper substitution is made for the pitcher, the  umpire shall direct the proper pitcher to return to the game until the  provisions of this rule are fulfilled. If the improper pitcher is  permitted to pitch, any play that results is legal. The improper  pitcher becomes the proper pitcher as soon as he makes his first pitch  to the batter, or as soon as any runner is put out. If a manager  attempts to remove a pitcher in violation of Rule 3.05 (c) the umpire  shall notify the manager of the offending club that it cannot be done.  If, by chance, the umpire in chief has, through oversight, announced  the incoming improper pitcher, he should still correct the situation  before the improper pitcher pitches. Once the improper pitcher delivers  a pitch he becomes the proper pitcher. <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>3.06</strong><br />
                            The manager shall immediately notify the umpire in chief of any  substitution and shall state to the umpire in chief the substitute's  place in the batting order. Players for whom substitutions have been  made may remain with their team on the bench or may &quot;warm up&quot; pitchers.  If a manager substitutes another player for himself, he may continue to  direct his team from the bench or the coach's box. Umpires should not  permit players for whom substitutes have been made, and who are  permitted to remain on the bench, to address any remarks to any  opposing player or manager, or to the umpires. <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>3.07</strong><br />
                            The umpire in chief, after having been notified, shall immediately announce, or cause to be announced, each substitution. <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>3.08</strong><br />
                            (a) If no announcement of a substitution is  made, the substitute shall be considered as having entered the game  when_ (1) If a pitcher, he takes his place on the pitcher's plate; (2)  If a batter, he takes his place in the batter's box;  (3) If a fielder, he reaches the position usually occupied by the  fielder he has replaced, and play commences; (4) If a runner, he takes  the place of the runner he has replaced. (b) Any play made by, or on,  any of the above mentioned unannounced substitutes shall be legal. <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>3.09</strong><br />
                            Players in uniform shall not address or mingle  with spectators, nor sit in the stands before, during, or after a game.  No manager, coach or player shall address any spectator before or  during a game. Players of opposing teams shall not fraternize at any  time while in uniform. <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>3.10</strong><br />
                            (a) The manager of the home team shall be the  sole judge as to whether a game shall be started because of unsuitable  weather conditions or the unfit condition of the playing field, except  for the second game of a doubleheader. EXCEPTION: Any league may  permanently authorize its president to suspend the application of this  rule as to that league during the closing weeks of its championship  season in order to assure that the championship is decided each year on  its merits. When the postponement of, and possible failure to play, a  game in the final series of a championship season between any two teams  might affect the final standing of any club in the league, the  president, on appeal from any league club, may assume the authority  granted the home team manager by this rule. (b) The umpire in chief of  the first game shall be the sole judge as to whether the second game of  a doubleheader shall not be started because of unsuitable weather  conditions or the unfit condition of the playing field. (c) The umpire  in chief shall be the sole judge as to whether and when play shall be  suspended during a game because of unsuitable weather conditions or the  unfit condition of the playing field; as to whether and when the play  shall be resumed after such suspension; and as to whether and when a  game shall be terminated after such suspension. He shall not call the  game until at least thirty minutes after he has suspended play. He may  continue the suspension as long as he believes there is any chance to  resume play. The umpire in chief shall at all times try to complete a  game. His authority to resume play following one or more suspensions of  as much as thirty minutes each shall be absolute and he shall terminate  a game only when there appears to be no possibility of completing it.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>3.11</strong><br />
                            Between games of a doubleheader, or whenever a game is suspended  because of the unfitness of the playing field, the umpire in chief  shall have control of ground keepers and assistants for the purpose of  making the playing field fit for play. PENALTY: For violation, the  umpire in chief may forfeit the game to the visiting team. <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>3.12</strong><br />
                            When the umpire suspends play he shall call  &quot;Time.&quot; At the umpire's call of &quot;Play,&quot; the suspension is lifted and  play resumes. Between the call of &quot;Time&quot; and the call of &quot;Play&quot; the  ball is dead.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>3.13</strong><br />
                            The manager of the home team shall present to the umpire in chief and  the opposing manager any ground rules he thinks necessary covering the  overflow of spectators upon the playing field, batted or thrown balls  into such overflow, or any other contingencies. If these rules are  acceptable to the opposing manager they shall be legal. If these rules  are unacceptable to the opposing manager, the umpire in chief shall  make and enforce any special ground rules he thinks are made necessary  by ground conditions, which shall not conflict with the official  playing rules. <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>3.14</strong><br />
                            Members of the offensive team shall carry all  gloves and other equipment off the field and to the dugout while their  team is at bat. No equipment shall be left lying on the field, either  in fair or foul territory.<br />
                            <strong><br />
                              3.15</strong><br />
                            No person shall be allowed on the playing field during a game except  players and coaches in uniform, managers, news photographers authorized  by the home team, umpires, officers of the law in uniform and watchmen  or other employees of the home club. In case of unintentional  interference with play by any person herein authorized to be on the  playing field (except members of the offensive team participating in  the game, or a coach in the coach's box, or an umpire) the ball is  alive and in play. If the interference is intentional, the ball shall  be dead at the moment of the interference and the umpire shall impose  such penalties as in his opinion will nullify the act of interference.  NOTE: See Rule 7.11 for individuals excepted above, also see Rule 7.08  (b). The question of intentional or unintentional interference shall be  decided on the basis of the person's action. For example: a bat boy,  ball attendant, policeman, etc., who tries to avoid being touched by a  thrown or batted ball but still is touched by the ball would be  involved in unintentional interference. If, however, he kicks the ball  or picks it up or pushes it, that is considered intentional  interference, regardless of what his thought may have been. PLAY:  Batter hits ball to shortstop, who fields ball but throws wild past  first baseman. The offensive coach at first base, to avoid being hit by  the ball, falls to the ground and the first baseman on his way to  retrieve the wild thrown ball, runs into the coach; the batter runner  finally ends up on third base. The question is asked whether the umpire  should call interference on the part of the coach. This would be up to  the judgment of the umpire and if the umpire felt that the coach did  all he could to avoid interfering with the play, no interference need  be called. If it appeared to the umpire that the coach was obviously  just making it appear he was trying not to interfere, the umpire should  rule interference.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>3.16</strong><br />
                            When there is spectator interference with any thrown or batted ball,  the ball shall be dead at the moment of interference and the umpire  shall impose such penalties as in his opinion will nullify the act of  interference. APPROVED RULING: If spectator interference clearly  prevents a fielder from catching a fly ball, the umpire shall declare  the batter out. There is a difference between a ball which has been  thrown or batted into the stands, touching a spectator thereby being  out of play even though it rebounds onto the field and a spectator  going onto the field or reaching over, under or through a barrier and  touching a ball in play or touching or otherwise interfering with a  player. In the latter case it is clearly intentional and shall be dealt  with as intentional interference as in Rule 3.15. Batter and runners  shall be placed where in the umpire's judgment they would have been had  the interference not occurred. No interference shall be allowed when a  fielder reaches over a fence, railing, rope or into a stand to catch a  ball. He does so at his own risk. However, should a spectator reach out  on the playing field side of such fence, railing or rope, and plainly  prevent the fielder from catching the ball, then the batsman should be  called out for the spectator's interference. Example: Runner on third  base, one out and a batter hits a fly ball deep to the outfield (fair  or foul). Spectator clearly interferes with the outfielder attempting  to catch the fly ball. Umpire calls the batter out for spectator  interference. Ball is dead at the time of the call. Umpire decides that  because of the distance the ball was hit, the runner on third base  would have scored after the catch if the fielder had caught the ball  which was interfered with, therefore, the runner is permitted to score.  This might not be the case if such fly ball was interfered with a short  distance from home plate. <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>3.17</strong><br />
                            Players and substitutes of both teams shall  confine themselves to their team's benches unless actually  participating in the play or preparing to enter the game, or coaching  at first or third base. No one except players, substitutes, managers,  coaches, trainers and bat boys shall occupy a bench during a game.  PENALTY: For violation the umpire may, after warning, remove the  offender from the field. Players on the disabled list are permitted to  participate in pre game activity and sit on the bench during a game but  may not take part in any activity during the game such as warming up a  pitcher, bench jockeying, etc. Disabled players are not allowed to  enter the playing surface at any time or for any purpose during the  game.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>3.18</strong><br />
                            The home team shall provide police protection sufficient to preserve  order. If a person, or persons, enter the playing field during a game  and interfere in any way with the play, the visiting team may refuse to  play until the field is cleared. PENALTY: If the field is not cleared  in a reasonable length of time, which shall in no case be less than  fifteen minutes after the visiting team's refusal to play, the umpire  may forfeit the game to the visiting team
